      "Question: What are the different methods for connecting to the Discovery cluster and accessing the Open OnDemand web portal?\n",
      "Answer: The two main methods for connecting to the Discovery cluster are using SSH through a terminal or using the web portal Open OnDemand (OOD). The OOD does not require the use of a Linux terminal. Both methods are outlined in the documentation and there is a training video available for reference.\n",
      "Question: What is the process for giving an external collaborator access to the cluster space at Northeastern University for data transfer using Globus?\n",
      "Answer: The process for giving an external collaborator access to the cluster space at Northeastern University for data transfer using Globus involves setting up a Khoury guest account and requesting approval from the group's supervisor. The collaborator may also need to submit a request for access and receive sponsor approval. It is recommended to follow the steps outlined in the university's public documentation and reach out to the appropriate support team for assistance.\n",
      "Question: What could be causing the SBATCH jobs to fail and how was the issue resolved?\n",
      "Answer: The issue was caused by the user's home directory being over quota, which was impacting the jobs. The user was advised to delete unnecessary files to stay under the quota limit, and once they did so, the jobs were able to run successfully.\n",
      "Question: What are the different methods for connecting to the Discovery cluster and how can I access the user documentation for each method?\n",
      "Answer: The two methods for connecting to the Discovery cluster are using SSH through a terminal or using the web portal Open OnDemand (OOD). The user documentation for each method can be found at the following links: \n",
      "1. SSH: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/first_steps/connect_mac.html (for Mac) or https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/first_steps/connect_windows.html (for Windows)\n",
      "2. OOD: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/first_steps/connect_ood.html \n",
      "You can also refer to the overall documentation for using Discovery at https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/index.html and schedule a consultation for further help at https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/.\n",
      "Question: What are the recommended methods for connecting to the Discovery cluster at Northeastern University's Research Computing (RC) department?\n",
      "Answer: The recommended methods for connecting to the Discovery cluster at Northeastern University's RC department are through SSH using a terminal or through the web portal Open OnDemand (OOD). The specific instructions for each method can be found in the documentation provided by RC.\n",
      "Question: How can I resolve issues with accessing a GitHub repository using a personal access token and SSH key in the context of research computing at Northeastern University?\n",
      "Answer: It seems that the issue may be related to the permissions on the SSH key file. By setting the permissions to 600 for the rsa_id file and 755 for the ~/.ssh directory, the user was able to successfully access the repository using the SSH URL. This solution may be helpful for others experiencing similar issues with accessing GitHub repositories in the context of research computing.\n",
      "Question: What was the process for granting access to the bansil partition on discovery for a collaborator of Professor Arun Bansil at the Department of Physics?\n",
      "Answer: The process involved the collaborator contacting Periaswamy, who then requested access from Northeastern University. The university then added the collaborator to the bansil partition and confirmed their access. Professor Bansil then approved the request, and Periaswamy informed him of the successful access.\n",
      "Question: Can a volunteer researcher retain access to the Discovery Cluster after their employment ends in order to continue their current research project?\n",
      "\n",
      "Answer: Yes, the volunteer researcher can retain access to the Discovery Cluster until the end of their sponsorship term, as long as their sponsor chooses to renew their account. They will need to move their data to a sponsored account and reassign their account to Research Computing.\n",
