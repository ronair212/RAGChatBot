Description : Hi,

I am PhD student at Prof. Stephen Intille's group. We would like to give one of our external collaborator access to our cluster space (/work/mhealthresearchgroup/) in order to use Globus to transfer large datasets. We have set up a Khoury guest account with this link, but the same username and password won't let him log in the "northeastern#discovery" collection on the Globus platform. We wonder if we apply for the wrong type of account or there is additional registration we need to go through.

Thanks a lot,
Jixin

Hi Keval,

It's RITM4346519. The collaborator's username is jo.kaslander.

I think he may have submitted a request for access to /work/mhealthresearchgroup/, but to make sure, could you help me to double check the progress of that?

Thanks,
Jixin

Chheda :
Hello, 

You might have received a RITM number. Can you please share that we me, so I can go ahead and check the status of the ticket. 

Best,

Li :
Hi Keval,

Our collaborator created a sponsored account and got the sponsor's approval on the access request ticket. When can we expect the account have access to the cluster space?

Thanks,

Description : Hi there,

I received several emails from Slurm this morning notifying me that 3 of my running SBATCH jobs failed at the same time. But as I checked the output log files, there's no indication of what's causing the jobs to fail - typically due to a node failure or program bug.

When I launch more A6000 jobs on my partition jiang​, they will instantly fail after a few seconds and without any log file outputs, but SRUN can still work normally. I wonder if it's caused by an issue on my end or if something is wrong with the cluster (SINFO doesn't show anything abnormal).

Thanks,
Tianye (Jerry) Ding
Computer Science | Northeastern
Khoury College of Computer Sciences
Email: ding.tian@northeastern.edu

Caplins :
Hi Tianye, 

Great to hear. I'll go ahead and close this ticket. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Ding :
Ah, SBATCH is working normally now as I further cleaned up my home directory. It's weird because I just checked my home directory size days ago, although the disk usage is already over 75GB SBATCH can still work normally, so I didn't pay much attention to it. Thanks for the help.

Caplins :
Hi Tianye, 

The first thing I notice is that your script is trying to write small log files to your home directory and your home is currently over quota. The quota is 75 GBs and you're at 80 GBs, most of which is in your .cache and .conda. Being over the limit can negatively impact your work.

You can check the quota yourself and see some advice on keeping it under the limit here: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/homequota.html

Can you try and delete a few things and see if your jobs run as expected? My guess as to why things work in srun and not sbatch is that the logs are not being written to home when you're running them interactively. 

Let me know if that seems to clear things up. If not I will look into it more. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Ding :
Hi, I wonder how's the progress of the ticket? Because the issue makes me unable to launch any research experiments. Thanks.

Caplins :
Hi Tianye, 

Thank you. I'll be looking into it. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Ding :
Hi, the job ids for previous running jobs that failed are 38249527, 38251299 and 38252997. And for the jobs that fail immediately after launching are 38263137, 38263479, 38272321, etc.

Caplins :
Hi Tianye, 

Do you have some of the jobids for the jobs that failed? I will look into it to try and determine what happened. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Description : Dear Research Computing,

I know that providing GitHub support isn’t your main focus, but I’m pretty desperate and hoping you can help.

GitHub bullied me into adopting a fine-grained personal access token system, and now I can’t access a repository, owned by a collaboration, for which I am an administrator/owner.

The error I keep getting is the following:



(sbmcal_139) [j.mccleary@login-01 superbit-metacal]$ git pull

Username for 'https://github.com': mcclearyj

Password for 'https://mcclearyj@github.com':

fatal: unable to access 'https://github.com/superbit-collaboration/superbit-metacal.git/': The requested URL returned error: 403

Git remote settings:

(sbmcal_139) [j.mccleary@login-01 superbit-metacal]$ git remote -v

origin https://github.com/superbit-collaboration/superbit-metacal.git (fetch)

origin git@github.com:superbit-collaboration/superbit-metacal.git<mailto:git@github.com:superbit-collaboration/superbit-metacal.git> (push)

I feel as though I have tried almost everything. On my Mac, the workaround was deleting all the saved GitHub keys, reauthenticating with some weird browser pop-up, and setting the remote url to SSH for pushing.


I tried that same hack (git remote set-url --push origin git@github.com:superbit-collaboration/superbit-metacal.git<mailto:git@github.com:superbit-collaboration/superbit-metacal.git>
)
But no luck. I tried creating an SSH key and then got yelled at for storing it in an insecure way (in j.mccleary/.ssh/rsa_id ???).

Nothing in the online docs or StackOverflow seems to be working. Do you have any guidance? I feel like I’m losing my mind here!

Thanks,
Jacqueline

Caplins :
Hi Jacqueline, 

Wonderful! Thank you for letting us know your solution. 

Feel free to reach out if you need any assistance in the future. 

Serena Caplins

McCleary :
Never mind, I fixed it!!

Here was my solution:

(1) Both the fetch and pull GitHub URLs are set to "ssh" so git@github.com/organization/repo.git
(2) I had already created SSH key with ssh-keygen and put the public key in my GitHub profile... 
(3) And to get around the yelling, I restricted the permissions to that rsa_id file: chmod 600 /home/j.mccleary/.ssh/rsa_id/ and chmod 755 ~/.ssh just to be safe (God bless this person https://stackabuse.com/how-to-fix-warning-unprotected-private-key-file-on-mac-and-linux/) 

I did update the repository permissions to allow PATs, and tried setting the remote urls to ones with the PATs, etc., all to no avail. This is the only thing that worked! Anyway, if someone else runs into this issue, hopefully this will help point them in the right direction.

If yes, how do we arrange this?

Shenoy :
Hi Robin,

Renata will have access to Discovery till your sponsorship for the account is valid. A mail will be sent to the sponsor when their sponsorship term nears its end. At that time if the sponsor chooses not to renew their account they will loose access to Discovery.

Caplins :
Hi Mohammad, 

Sounds good. She will receive an email once she has access. 

We do have restrictions on GPU access in that the length of a given job (session on the OOD or sbatch or srun on the terminal) is limited to 8 hours and a user can only have 8 GPU jobs running at a given time. 

You can see more information on using GPUs at the link I provided.

Description : To whom it may concern

I have a problem with installing devtools in R. I made a conda environment, and I installed r-base 4.3.1. Then I tried to install devtools but I got the errors. Please find attached the file as the description of the errors.
I also tried to use available R modules in the cluster, yet the same issues happened with installing devtools in R.



I would appreciate your help in advance.

Kind regards,

Sina

Rafiee :
reply from: m.rafiee@northeastern.edu

Hi Serena,

Thank you very much for your advice. It solved the problem.

Kind regards,
S.

Caplins :
Hi Sina, 

It looks like devtools is looking for a compiler that isn't present in your conda environment. 

Can you try installing it with conda via this command (or similar): conda install -c conda-forge r-devtools

That should get you devtools and the compilers (libfretype-devel etc) that it needs. Conda is able to add in compilers where R cannot. 

Let me know if that works and hopefully you don't run into conflicts. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Periaswamy :
Hello Daniel,

Thank you for booking a consultation with me, here's a brief summary of our discussion:

Discovery serves as Northeastern University's prominent High-Performance Computing (HPC) cluster, boasting an impressive array of resources including over 25,000 cores, 200 GPUs, and equipped with SLURM, InfiniBand, and Isilon technologies. This system is made available for both research and classroom applications to the university's students and faculties. To get started with Discovery, I kindly recommend initiating an access request ticket through this link: https://bit.ly/NURC-AccessRequest.

During our conversation, we addressed the following matters:

1. You expressed your interest in using Discovery for your classroom application. We thoroughly examined the requisite procedure, delving into the documentation associated with submitting a classroom request to the Research Computing team. To briefly recap, you can initiate a classroom application request using the following link: https://bit.ly/NURC-Classroom. Additionally, I would also suggest going through the classroom application FAQ: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/classroom/class_use.html

2. We discussed your intention to leverage "ls-dyna" on the cluster. However, it appears that the software is not currently installed. I would recommend submitting a software installation request for "ls-dyna" via this link: https://bit.ly/NURC-Software.

Please do not hesitate to reach out if you require any further guidance or clarification.

Best,

Surya

Hi Zongyu,

The command you're currently using appears to be generating links when you're likely wanting to create a simple list of package names and versions. I suggest you use the following command instead:

pip list --format=freeze > requirements.txt

This should create a list without including any URLs or file paths. If you pass this new file to Salah, he should be able to install the packages without encountering the error message he's been seeing.

Please let me know if this resolves your problem.

Hello Zongyu,

Your Request has been updated by DWADASI, PRASANTH



Comments:

________________________________
DWADASI :
Hi Zongyu and Salah,

The error message "Disk quota exceeded" indicates that you've surpassed your allocated disk space. For /home it was 75GB.

For Zongyu, your current usage of /home is at 39GB. Could you please inform us about the 'Working Directory' from where you were launching the JupyterLab? Also, did you clear your /home directory after encountering the error?

For Salah, your /home usage is significantly high at 881GB, which greatly exceeds the 75GB limit. Here are some suggestions to help manage and reduce your disk usage:

Possible suggestions:

1. Move runs to /scratch and important data should be backed up to /work
if your PI doesn’t have space in /work :
New Storage Space request: https://bit.ly/NURC-NewStorage
2. Clean the ~/ondemand logs directory occasionally
3. Clear the ~/.conda directory:
1. Clean unused packages and caches:
`source activate <your environment>
conda clean --all`
This will not delete unused packages located in, say /shared/centos7/anaconda3/2021.11/pkgs
but will remove packages in your local ~/.conda/pkgs folder.
2. Clean unused conda environments:
`conda env list`
`conda env remove --name <name>
OR
conda env remove --prefix=<absolute-path-to-the-environment>`
3. If you plan to create new conda environments in the future, the best would be use it with the `--prefix` command and install it in a permanent group storage share (under /work). For example:
`conda create myenv --prefix=/work/<mygroup>/<mydirectory>`
https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/create.html
4. Perform regular `du -sh *`

To figure out directory usage:

1. Go to a compute node.

2. Run: `du -shc /<directory>/*`

3. du -h --max-depth=1 `/<directory>`

5. Clean `~/.cache` (make sure no processes are using it currently).
6. Additional possible culprit is the `~/.singularity` directory which stores a copy of all pulled images: `singularity cache clean all`

Best,
Prasanth

Hi Zongyu and Salah,

The error message "Disk quota exceeded" indicates that you've surpassed your allocated disk space. For /home it was 75GB. 

For Zongyu, your current usage  of /home is at 39GB. Could you please inform us about the 'Working Directory' from where you were launching the JupyterLab? Also, did you clear your /home directory after encountering the error?

For Salah, your /home usage is significantly high at 881GB, which greatly exceeds the 75GB limit. Here are some suggestions to help manage and reduce your disk usage:

Possible suggestions:

1. Move runs to /scratch and important data should be backed up to /work
if your PI doesn’t have space in /work :
New Storage Space request: https://bit.ly/NURC-NewStorage
2. Clean the ~/ondemand logs directory occasionally 
3. Clear the ~/.conda directory: 
    1. Clean unused packages and caches: 
    `source activate <your environment>
    conda clean --all`
    This will not delete unused packages located in, say /shared/centos7/anaconda3/2021.11/pkgs
    but will remove packages in your local ~/.conda/pkgs folder.
    2. Clean unused conda environments:
    `conda env list`
    `conda env remove --name <name>
    OR
    conda env remove --prefix=<absolute-path-to-the-environment>`
    3. If you plan to create new conda environments in the future, the best would be use it with the `--prefix` command and install it in a permanent group storage share (under /work). For example:
    `conda create myenv --prefix=/work/<mygroup>/<mydirectory>`
    https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/create.html
4. Perform regular `du -sh *` 
    
    To figure out directory usage:
    
    1. Go to a compute node.
    
    2. Run: `du -shc /<directory>/*`
    
    3. du -h --max-depth=1 `/<directory>`
    
5. Clean `~/.cache` (make sure no processes are using it currently). 
6. Additional possible culprit is the `~/.singularity` directory which stores a copy of all pulled images: `singularity cache clean all`

Best,
Prasanth

Description : Hi,


I hope all is well! I was running a couple of jobs that died out of the sudden. One of them was running ~9 days (jobid: 37497384) and the other ran ~3 days (jobid: 37758622), both the time limit of 15 days. The error message that I get is the below. Would you be able to help me find a way to prevent this? I had another job (jobid 37332764) that did not die and is still running with a time limit of 64 days.

Hello Christian,

I am going to resolve this ticket since we haven't heard back from you in a bit. If you have any other questions please reach out to Research Computing at the following links: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/welcome/gettinghelp.html

Thank you,

Hello Christian,

I am just reaching out to see if this problem has occurred again and if checkpointing is possible? It looks like you are running pyrai2md in your scripts and not sure if you are able to checkpoint that workflow. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Christian,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. Sorry for the delay in answering your question. We were having NODE FAILURE issues a little bit back with network hardware issues from the MAPO maintenance window. 

Have you encountered the issues since the two jobs that failed? 

Also is it possible to checkpoint or create save states for your jobs because occasionally problems can occur with long run time jobs and it is best to have a checkpoint to fall back onto so you can resume from that point. What application are you running in your jobs?

Thank you,

Joseph

Hi CAM, 

Yes. you can follow the steps here using FTP Command Line Basics: https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/sra/docs/submitfiles/
Before you start the transfer you will want to be on the xfer node. You can ssh via the command below or use mobaxterm.

You can then navigate to where the data is that you want to upload and start the ftp protocol.

Description : I am trying to use Jupyter notebook but my session doesn't start saying there's no space. But I haven't used that much of space so I am not sure why I am getting this error. When I tried to check the list of files it shows me some random files which are not even in my folder. Need assistance with this

Cooke :
Hello Haritha,

Thank you for letting me know that you were able to use Open OnDemand after cleaning up some files in your $HOME directory. I am going to resolve this ticket since everything is working as normal. If you have any other questions please reach out to Research Computing at the following links: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/welcome/gettinghelp.html

Thank you,

Joseph

Selvakumaran :
Yes, the trash contained 73 GB, so I deleted that and was able to use resources normally.

Cooke :
Hello Haritha,

I am just reaching out to see if you were able to get your $HOME size under the quota and if you were able to get OOD to open.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Haritha,

You are welcome! Normally .local gets populated with python libraries if you use pip install without being in a conda environment. How do you normally install python libraries? You can change directories into your .local

cd .local 

and explore what directories are in there to get an idea what might have made that directory so large. You can use the pip uninstall command to uninstall unused python packages and clean up the directory that way. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Selvakumaran :
Thank you, I'll go through the links. Is there any way to free up those 73 GB of space that my .local is consuming?

Cooke :
Hello Haritha,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. The error message you are receiving is because your /home space is over quota. Everyone has a 75 GB quota and you are currently at 103 GB. Open OnDemand creates log files when you open up the application and since you are over quota it can't write them and cannot open.

You can check your /home space by running the following command in your $HOME space.

du -shc .[^.]* *

and the output is

512     .bash_history
512     .bash_logout
512     .bash_profile
512     .bashrc
354M    .cache
1.2G    .conda
0       .config
512     .emacs
801K    .ipython
9.5K    .jupyter
512     .keras
512     .kshrc
73G     .local
512     .ssh
512     .Xauthority
30G     ChemXplore
46K     ondemand
103G    total

It looks like your .local is large at 73 GB which sometimes occurs when pip installs packages there instead of your conda environments. Also you have 30 GB in ChemXplore, is that research related? If you are working with a PI, they can have a /work space and all research related work can be stored there which will help with your home quota. 

For python environments and home quota best practices, please see the following pages:

https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/conda.html
https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/homequota.html

Do you have any other questions?

Thank you,

Cooke :
Hello Harin,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. The sudoers list is restricted and that is why you have received that message because researchers are not part of the group that has that access. 

Have you checked to see if the program you are trying to use is already installed as a module? You can check and see what we have installed on Discovery with 'module avail' and it will show all the modules. 

We have researchers install software through other ways including package managers like conda (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/conda.html) and spack (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/spack.html) or you can build the program from source using make or CMake (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/softwareoverview.html#using-make) with using the --prefix flag for make and the equivalent in CMake. If the software you are trying to install would be helpful for others to use as well and you would like it to be installed as module you can submit a request here (https://bit.ly/NURC-Software) for us to look into it.

What is the program you are trying to install? We can also offer assistance in tickets like this in advice and steps to take to install it yourself in your work space. 

Please let me know if this helps and if there is anything else that I can assist with.

Thank you,

Joseph

Hello Emma,

Could you try the following command and see if it solves the issue?

chmod -R 2775 /work/cnelab/TECHS/data/techs_07

This should recursively change the permission of all the files in the directory mentioned.
Also, it is essential that the owner of the directory run this command (In this case it would be you)

Do note the depending on the number of files for which the permissions need to change the whole process might take some time.

Thank you,

Shenoy :
Hello Emma,

This issue is the group does not have access to the directories and files created by you (even though they are present inside /work/cnelab). For everyone in cnelab to be able to access the directories present in /work/cnelab/TECHS/data/techs07 cnelab must have read and write access to the files and directories.
One way to provide these permissions is to run the following command on each of the directories

chmod g+w on techs_07
chmod g+w on techs_06

A more sophisticated method would be to follow the mentioned steps:

1. Create a script file with .sh extension on discovery and paste the contents in it:

To create the file:
# touch change_permissions.sh

Paste the below lines in change_permissions.sh :
#!/bin/bash

# Check if the directory argument is provided
if [ -z "$1" ]; then
echo "Please provide the directory path"
exit 1
fi

# Set the directory
BASEDIR="$1"

# Check if the directory exists
if [ ! -d "$BASEDIR" ]; then
echo "Directory does not exist"
exit 1
fi

# For files that are not group-writable and adding the group-writable bit
find "$BASEDIR" -type f ! -perm -g=w -exec chmod g+w {} \;

# For files that are user-executable adding the group-executable bit
find "$BASEDIR" -type f -perm -u=x ! -perm -g=x -exec chmod g+x {} \;

# For directories that are not group-writable or executable and add the group-writable and executable bits
find "$BASEDIR" -type d ! -perm -g=wx -exec chmod g+wx {} \;

2. Make the script executable:
# chmod +x change_permissions.sh

3. To run the script on a particular directory, please use the path of the directory.
# ./change_permissions.sh /path_to_dir


This will iteratively traverse through the whole directory and change the permission of all the files and directories inside it.

Hope this helps. Do let me know if you need any more help with this.

Thank you,
Prajwal

Description : Hi,

I had two large datasets (18.3Gb and 91.9Gb) and planned to test the code on them. During the running process, it will generate more data which requires more memory. I knew that only scratch was available to me for this memory requirement, but the data will be cleaned after 20 days in such directory. After that, I will need to upload those datasets again. Is there any way to load such large datasets easily and quickly each time?

Hello Huiyu,


Thank you for reaching out RC.
To transfer large amounts of data from your local machine to the cluster, I would recommend using Globus. Globus is a data management system and Northeastern has a subscription to Globus. Setting up Globus is straightforward and is comprehensively outlined here: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/globus.html. I also recommend going through our other data transfer solutions outlined here: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html. Since the data is going to be persistent another solution here would be to request extra space under /work. This can be done by your PI: https://bit.ly/NURC-NewStorage


I hope this was helpful.


Best,
Surya

Description : Hi,

I was wondering if there is a way to download all my datafiles located in a particular directory at once (for instance in https://ood.discovery.neu.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/files/fs//work/pinelab/Studies/Khula/03_Capetown/visit_1_3mo/HAPPE_Processed_EEG/BaselineEEG/Default%20HAPPE%20preprocessing/Usable_Processed_Files) instead of downloading them individually because that is very time consuming and I end up downloading a single file more than once in this process. Right now, there doesn’t seem to be an option where I can select all files (their corresponding checkboxes) using a single common button before hitting download. If I try downloading the folder instead, it says that the size is too large to be zipped for download. Any solution would be much appreciated.

Thanks,
Priyanka

Robinson :
Greetings:

Are you comfortable with the command line?

If so, zip the file that way, and then download the single zip file

zip -r data.zip data/ (pointing to the directory of interest)

Also, if you are a Linux or a Mac, then open the terminal, and rsync directly, https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html#transfer-via-terminal

(click on the RSync tab)

Hi Kasun, 

I'm looking into this issue now. I don't see anything terribly odd in your output.log files. Do you mind trying to reset the webserver and see if that solves the problem?

You can do this by going to the "Develop" and select "Restart Web Server". And then try and relaunch an instance of VMD.

Recently, I have installed MDAnalysis through conda on Discovery cluster, but I get "Segmentation fault" error during working with MDAnalysis.

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hello Masoud,

Thank you for sharing the scripts, they are definitely helpful. However, to effectively replicate and diagnose the issue, we would also require access to the data you were using. Could you let us know if we have your permission to copy the data for testing? If so, please provide the path where the data resides.

Additionally, could you provide the full error trace related to the segmentation fault you are encountering? This would greatly assist us in resolving the issue.

Thank you,
Prasanth

Keramati :
reply from: keramati.m@northeastern.edu

Hi Prasanth,

Thank you for your response.

MDAnalysis is not available on the cluster and I installed it with Conda.
I allocated 128 GB for memory and I think it is enough.
I used the attached scripts.


Best,

Masoud

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Masoud,

Thank you for reaching out and detailing your issue with MDAnalysis on the Discovery cluster. I want to assure you that we've successfully installed and operated MDAnalysis on our end without encountering any difficulties.

In order to assist you more effectively, could you please provide additional details regarding the error you're encountering? Additionally, sharing any specific scripts or steps you're following to replicate the issue would be extremely helpful.

A segmentation fault often indicates an issue with memory management. Have you considered increasing the memory allocated to the job? Sometimes, this adjustment can rectify segmentation faults.

Looking forward to your response.

Best regards,
Prasanth

Description : Hi,

I need to install  libasound2-dev portaudio19-dev in my discovery computer for a research project with Dr. Fu, but it shows I can’t use ‘sudo’ to install since I’m not in the sudoers file. So can you add me in this file or how can I install them?

Wenqing

Caplins :
Hi Wenqing, 

Thank you for contacting RC with your request. Only admin can have sudo access. However, there are many ways to install packages locally without sudo. You can review our guide on installing software here: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/index.html

It looks like those are compilers needed for another program, we recommend using conda as a package manager to install the program you need (when it's available on conda) as the compilers will be installed alongside the program you need in an environment. For example, this may help if this is the program you're planning on using https://github.com/Rayhane-mamah/Tacotron-2/issues/310

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.

For my lab I need access to Gaussian, I am able to login to the system, but whenever I go to run a program it says "no network".

To view your current disk usage, please use the following command:
$ du -h -d 1 /home/kazeminajafabadi.a

https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/homequota.html :

1. Consider cleaning up some packages which are no longer needed in /home/kazeminajafabadi.a/.local/
2. Consider using conda virtual environments or pip virtualenv to manage your packages. This will give you more flexibility to export your Python environment to different places if needed.
3. Rebuild your Python environment inside a dedicated group /work directory. $ pip install --target=d:\somewhere\other\than\the\default package_name
If your group doesn't have a shared storage space under /work yet please request your PI/advisor to fill in the "New Storage Space request" form: https://bit.ly/NURC-NewStorage. Note that this request has to be filled out just once by a faculty member from your group.
The location /work is persistent storage, where each research group gets up to 35TB of free storage across all storage tiers. See this page for more info:https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/storage/discovery_storage.html#discovery-storage
4. Consider moving all of your important data folders to the /work-shared group location for permanent storage.

So sorry for the delay in responding to you. We do have an archive of your home. Have you been able to get set up with a sponsored account yet?

Hi Liwen, 

I believe getting a sponsored account would get you the service now user account. All the accounts are set up through your northeastern account. 

What was your previous /home username? I don't see an account for your current northeastern email: hou.li

I can look for your old home directory and it likely is still in /home if you have the username.

Hi Serena,

I still have a Northeastern email address. My problem is that I seem to not
have access to a ServiceNow user account, which is why I cannot see the
form. Separately, I have a question about the Discovery cluster: If I last
used the cluster around 8 months ago, will I be able to get back the
contents of my home directory after I get a new account? My home directory
on the cluster had many important files.

Thanks!

Liwen Hou

Caplins :
Hi Liwen, 

Oh sorry, I hadn't realized you graduated. You will need to have your sponsor have you classified as a visiting researcher (or something similar, it may vary by department) which will allow you to have a northeastern email again. Once you have that you will be able to apply for access. We can only make accounts for users with a northeastern email address. But there is a path for these to be made for collaborators etc. 

I would ask your Professor to request that you have a visiting scholar status. They can ask the admin in their department how to go about setting this up as it seems to vary, and it is outside of what I can directly help you with in Research Computing. 

Let me know if you have any questions.
Cheers, 
Serena

Caller :
reply from: hou.l@husky.neu.edu

I don't have access to the form, likely due to graduation. I get the
following error:

"The page you're trying to reach is unable to authenticate your account.
Some possible reasons for this error include:
Your single sign-on session has expired
Your NUID does not match a ServiceNow user account
Single sign-on is experiencing technical difficulties"

Caplins :
Hi Liwen, 

You can apply for access via this form here. https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0ae24596db535fc075892f17d496199c

It will ask for your sponsor and you can enter Prof. David Smith who will then have to approve your request. Once we have approval we will create your account on Discovery. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

Thank you
Supriya Vallarapu

Cooke :
Hello Supriya,

No worries. I just wanted to make sure the issue had been resolved and you were able to use OOD. I am going to resolve this ticket. If you have any other questions please reach out to Research Computing at the following links: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/welcome/gettinghelp.html

Thank you,

Joseph

Vallarapu :
Hello Joseph,

Yes the issue has been resolved. I think I have mentioned this but not sure I think it didn’t get posted. Sorry for that. Thank you so much for you help

Cooke :
Hello Supriya,

I am just reaching out to see if this issue is still persisting or if you are able to use JupyterLab okay now?

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Supriya,

Are you able to open up the directory that you were trying to open in JupyterLab now? We fixed up your account on Friday and I was wondering if have been able to access and use JupyterLab now. If not, please let me know and we can continue to look into what might be the error that is causing this message to occur. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Amy,

Thank you for letting me know that you are Supriya sponsor. I will add that information to the Discovery account. Also no problem about looking into this and hopefully we can get all of this setup correctly soon and make sure this corrects the issue. 

Thank you, 

Joseph

Hello Supriya,

Thank you for letting me know that you are able to open JupyterLab in your $HOME directory. What is the Work Directory path you are entering when you are receiving the proxy error?

Thank you,

Joseph

Vallarapu :
Hello Joseph,

I could able to open the jupyter notebook now with this now  (If you could try and put in /home/vallarapu.s to see if launching the application in your $HOME directory will allow it to launch.) Thank you for your help.

Pei :
Hi Joseph, 

I am the sponsor. My email is l.pei@northeastern.edu. Thanks for looking into Supriya's account setup.

Amy

Cooke :
Hello Supriya,

I have a follow up question. Who is your sponsor for your Discovery account? The proxy error might be because your account is not finished being setup and that is something I can do if I know your sponsor. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Supriya,

When you are loading the JupyterLab OOD application, are you inputting a `Work Directory` in the form?  If you could try and put in /home/vallarapu.s to see if launching the application in your $HOME directory will allow it to launch.  If you could also try and launch another application from the OOD menu to see if you are able to launch it as well it will help to see if this is just an isolated JupyterLab issue.

Thank you,

Joseph

Vallarapu :
Hello Joseph, Yes I am still encountering the problem with jupyter Lab as I am working only with this now

Cooke :
Hello Supriya,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. I am sorry you encountered this error. We are looking into the possible cause of this occurring. Is it still effecting you or was it just yesterday?  Was it only on JupyterLab or other applications as well?

Thank you,

Joseph

Description : Hi Team,

I'm unable to access Jupyter Notebook over my discovery account due to "Disk quota error...", I've attached a screenshot of the same. Can someone please help me with this issue? Thank you for your time and efforts!

Thanks,

Hi Surya,

That has fixed the problem. You may close this ticket, thanks!

Thanks,
Aditi

Periaswamy :
Hello Aditi,


Your current $HOME utilization is 221GB which is way over the 75GB $HOME limit which we have set. To see your current $HOME utilization please use the following command: $ du -shc .[^.]* ~/*
It appears to me that the folders "Yelp", ".local" and ".conda" seems to be taking up the most space. Here are my suggestions to resolve this issue
Remove unused packages and clear caches of conda : 
$ source activate <your environment>

$ conda clean --all
Remove any unused conda environments:
$ conda env list
$ conda env remove --name <your environment>
pip install normally saves things in .local, consider removing unused packages
I can see that the folder Yelp is taking up 116GB of space, if it is a dataset and if you are running temporary tests on it please consider moving it to /scratch. If it is something which you would be working long term please request a space under /work: https://bit.ly/NURC-NewStorage

Please go through our comprehensive documentation regarding the best practices to keep $HOME under quota: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/homequota.html

Thank you,

Surya P

Periaswamy :
Hello Aditi,

Please let me know if your issue is resolved.

Best,
Surya

m.joshi (Work notes) :
would be good to bring attention to our documentation on this as well

https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/homequota.html

Cooke :
Anyone can take the ticket. I just wanted to do a breakdown on what the user should focus on to get their $HOME under quota. Thank you.

Cooke :
Hello Aditi,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. The error you are receiving in OOD is because your $HOME is over the quota (quota is set to 75 GB) and OOD needs to generate log files and other files in your $HOME when you launch it. Your current disk usage is 221G  in your $HOME. 

I just looked and the large directories are:

47G     .conda
49G     .local
116G    Yelp

If you can reduce the disk usage to be below 75 GB you will be able to open the OOD applications again. 

If you are working in a research group, does your PI have a /work space that you can move research related work there? 

Also everyone has a /scratch space associated with their account but that is purged for files that are older than 28 days so please be cautious since that isn't meant for long term storage. 

Here is our documentation on storage https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/storage/discovery_storage.html

Thank you,

Joseph

We can close this ticket now.  Thanks!

Crookes :
Thanks for checking.  I will do that .  I can't say that I tried it over the weekend for this, but I was also having problems with Duo Mobile fully loading this weekend for another authentication for massparc and  using Edge or Chrome incognito on my laptop or Safari on my mobile didn't work.  Not asking you to solve that, it's resolved also.  Still, I'll add it to my troubleshooting steps for SAS on my end.    

I bounce between R and SAS :

Cooke :
Hello Danielle,

I talked with Greg Shomo about this issue and from the error message you are receiving and the delay it had before it started working again from when I moved the file on Friday, it seems that it is browser cacheing issue. Moving the .sasstudio directory in your $HOME allows the program to generate a new profile which allowed you get around the initialization error you were receiving before but the delay this time was your browser most likely had the error cached and it wasn't allowing it to operate normally.

What we would like to do next, is if this error happens again, we are going to have you test out theory and that is we will move the .sasstudio directory and then have you launch the session from a chrome incognito session or a firefox private browsing session. These modes don't use the cookies and cache that is already stored on your compute and acts as if you  cleared them without having to clear them for the test. If you are able to use the site immediately after, then we know it is a cacheing error that is taking place.

What was the last workflow you ran in SAS Studio before the error occurred? Did the session end cleanly or did it crash or something of that level?

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Danielle,

That is good that it is working now but sorry it wasn't working over the weekend. No problem on following up quickly. Currently I do not have a sense as to why this is happening. I will talk with the systems team to see if there is something else that can be done or a possible cause as to why this is happening.

Thank you,

Joseph

Crookes :
Hi Joseph, 

wasn't over the weekend :

Danielle

Cooke :
Hello Danielle,

I am reaching out to see if that corrected the issue you were encountering when trying to sign in on SAS Studio or if you are still unable to sign into SAS Studio. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Danielle,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. I just moved your .sasstudio directory to .sasstudio-off2. Could you please try and log in and see if that corrects the issue when the program creates another directory for its profile?

Thank you,

Joseph

Periaswamy :
Hello Andrew,

Thank you for confirming that your issue was resolved. So regarding maestro here are my suggestions :

1. Using OOD would circumvent a lot of configuration headaches. The recent updates to OOD have made it more robust and reliable

https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-ood/introduction.html

2. X11 Forwarding is already possible using the -Y flag in SSH. More details regarding this can be found here :

https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/first_steps/connect_windows.html#using-x11-on-windows
https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/first_steps/connect_mac.html#using-x11-on-mac

https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/modules.html#using-software-applications-with-x11-forwarding

3. A nice middle ground would be to generate the input locally and then use discovery to process it. This method could also prove to be convenient.

Best,
Surya

Hawkins :
reply from: b.hawkins@northeastern.edu

Hi Surya,

This did correct the problem thank you.

I have another question. Have you any experience with linking maestro from a local PC to discovery using the SLURM method. I was hoping to establish this for the GPU or MUltiGPU partition.

Hello Andrew,

Periaswamy :
Hello Bryson Andrew,

Thank you for your patience. After investigating the issue, it appears that the conda setup in your .bashrc might be causing the problem. Here are my suggestions to resolve this:

First, take a copy of your current .bashrc file for backup: $ cp ~/.bashrc .bashrc.old
Next, copy the default .bashrc file from /etc/skel to your home directory: $ cp /etc/skel/.bashrc ~ 

Try using the XFCE Beta OOD App. This might provide a solution to the issue you are facing.
If you wish to keep any modifications you made in the backed-up .bashrc file, please do so carefully to avoid any conflicts with the XFCE Desktop OOD App.

I hope these suggestions prove helpful in resolving the problem.

Thank you,
Surya

Description : Dear rc team,
I asked the discovery team why I can't access courses files they said I have no access to it and in binf6309 I can't access this link. So can I download the required files to my directory and then run the program by changing the paths. It's working that way.
In the email below it says I can use rstudio under courses but I have no access to it?
but I am using the binf6308 rstudio . It says there is no courses directory in work folder. She replied it would work but for me it doesn't

Caplins :
Hi Emma, 

Do you have a screen shot showing what you see when you launch the xfce desktop? FYI sometimes conda environments can interfere with the OOD particularly with xfce. If you have a "conda init" statement in your /home/$USER/.bashrc file you can comment it out and log out/ log in and re-launch an xfce session to see if that fixes it. 

Here's an example of the conda init statement. https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/first_steps/shellenvironment.html#conda-and-bashrc

Happy to help more if that isn't the issue. 

Cheers,

Description : Hi,

I have been unable to submit batch files to run StarCCM+ simulations for a few days now.
On logging in to the SSH terminal, I am seeing this error:
/usr/bin/xauth:  error in locking authority file /home/anumandla.p/.Xauthority

Is this why I am unable to submit jobs? Or is it something else?

Thanks,

Pranav

Anumandla :
Got it! 
Thanks for your help!

Caplins :
Hi Pranav, 

Great. The "quickest" way is with the command: du -h --max-depth=1 /home/anumandla.p

You could also run a simpler: du -sh /home/anumandla.p

but the second will only give you the status of your whole home. The first breaks it down by folder. 

These commands run slowly if you have a lot of files or large files.....so it's a bit slow for a "full" home like yours. 

I'll close this ticket now. Please reach out if you need help with anything else!

Cheers, 
Serena

Anumandla :
Hi Serena,

Yes, freeing up space solved it. I am able submit jobs and run them.
Also, is there a quick way for me to see the storage status of my /home folder?

Have you gotten this sorted out yet? You need to delete some files from your home directory. Once you do that you can submit jobs and things will run normally again.

Cheers, 
Serena

Caplins :
Hi Pranav, 

It looks like you're over the storage limit in your /home. The limit is set to 75 GBs and you're at 99 GBs. 

Please take a look at our documentation on ways to keep /home under the quota. https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/homequota.html

Here's a breakdown of your home using the command du -h --max-depth=1 /home/anumandla.p

156K /home/anumandla.p/.sanconf
3.5K /home/anumandla.p/.ssh
16K /home/anumandla.p/.star-16.06.010
21G /home/anumandla.p/Solution History 1-1 LES
6.0K /home/anumandla.p/Substrate Tracks
12M /home/anumandla.p/Substrate Tracks 1-1
22M /home/anumandla.p/Substrate Tracks 1-1 Escape
38M /home/anumandla.p/Substrate Tracks 1-1 LES
85M /home/anumandla.p/Substrate Tracks 1-2
131K /home/anumandla.p/Substrate Tracks 2-2
16M /home/anumandla.p/Substrate Tracks 3-2
44K /home/anumandla.p/ondemand
99G /home/anumandla.p

In your case it looks like most of the space is taken up by files in your home (slurm outputs). If you need those accessible to you we suggest putting them in work. Or if they can be archived you can put them all in one directory and tar or zip it to reduce the space they are taking. 

Hope that helps!
Serena

Hi Jin,

Thanks for reaching out to RC.
We've added you to long partition. This change will take effect within 2-3 hours, and you can start running jobs once you're able to see the "long" group when typing the command:
$ groups

To run jobs on the multigpu partition, use the Slurm flag --partition=long.

Best,

Jin :
RITM Update: reply from: q.jin@northeastern.edu

Hi Prasanth,

Thanks for your respond.  We still think that we need the long code for those two projects with the following reasons.

  1.  For the ""Stochastic differential modeling of cardiomyocyte models". We are aware that increasing nodes can let the Monte Carlo simulations running in parallel. , for a single simulation (one realization of Monte Carlo ), it will be longer than 24hrs. The reason is that, in our project, we need to identify the steady state of our model. To do it numerically (can only do it numerically for our highly nonlinear model), we need to run each realization of Monte Carlo for a much longer time to identify the steady state of each realization. Multiple nodes will not help for this. Thanks for the suggestions of the job array submission, will look into that.

  2.  For the "Causal analysis for high dimensional large cohort project", Theoretically yes, we are able to write additional code to do that. However, it does involve a lot of additional work. The available R package does not support breaking down. We have to write our own code, which is going to be a large effort. It would be much easier to have a >24hr node.

Hope these reasons are sufficient to request for the long partition. Thank you. Please let me know if you have any questions.

Best regards,
Qingchu

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Jin,

Thank you for getting in touch with RC, and for the detailed description of your projects that require Long partition access.

48 cores per node across 30 compute nodes :

For the script you shared, I noticed repeated lines where you are using sleep 90 followed by sbatch run_discovery.sh. Instead of repeating these lines, you can simplify this process by employing array jobs in SLURM. By using array jobs, you can launch multiple jobs at once, making the process more efficient.

You can find more information about SLURM job arrays and how to utilize them in our documentation here: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/slurm.html#slurm-job-arrays

Regarding your second project, "Causal analysis for high dimensional large cohort," I noticed that a portion of the intervention takes 16 hours, and the full training may extend to 36 hours. Could this process be broken down and checkpointed to run in segments? By doing so, you might be able to reduce the total job time to under 24 hours.

Your response to these considerations will guide us in proceeding with the grant of access to the Long partition.

Best,
Prasanth

Description : Hello,

My name is Christian de Frondeville, and I am a master's bioengineering student at Northeastern (NUID 001394441). I am working for Barabasi laboratories on several projects, and one of them in particular necessitates the use of multiple gpus. I have approval from Matteo and other network science personnel to gain access to these partitions, and I wanted to formalize this request.

Thank you,
Christian

Caplins :
Hi Christian, 

I've added you to the netsi partition. This change will take approximately 2 hours to take effect throughout the cluster. 

Matteo, Sorry about the confusion. We do have a form for access requests to add a new user to Discovery but not to add a user to a private partition. But in the future I can respond to these messages with an email instead of just adding you to the watchlist. 

Thank you and let me know if there is anything else needed!
Cheers, 
Serena

Chinazzi :
Added a screenshot of an older approval request for your reference.

Chinazzi :
*I noticed this open ticket

Chinazzi :
Hi Serena, I confirm that Christian should have access.
However I do not see any approval request in my tickets, only this exchange and I was not notified by email.

It would be great if for next approval a formal request is sent my way, otherwise I am not notified (I just double checked my email and I did not receive any approval request, I notified this open ticket only because Christian wrote me a direct email while normally I would get emails with the subject line such as "Approval Required for: RITM4333486").

Thank you!

Caplins :
Hi Christian and Matteo,

Sorry I understand now. I am always learning about new private partitions. Let me just loop in Matteo for confirmation and once that's in hand I can add you to the netsi_gpu partition. 


Cheers, 
Serena

De Frondeville :
Is this the same as the NetSci partitions? I was told that there were network-science specific partitions that are not the same as the multigpu partitions, and that I would need to go through RC support first so that the netsci supervisor could sign off on them.

Caplins :
Hi Christian, 

Thank you for contacting RC with this request. We have a testing procedure that preceeds access to multigpu. You can apply for access to that first and then we can add you to the multigpu partition. https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0c34d402db0b0010a37cd206ca9619b7

Description : Hi RC Help Staff,

I had an error when using OOD today, it happened whether I want to start a new app or view the previous sessions. It says internal Server error.


"#Errno::EDQUOT: Disk quota exceeded @ rb_sysopen - /home/zhang.zheyul/ondemand/data/sys/dashboard/
connect/db/6f0d1e23-3ed7-4be8-8bbc-84323ff8a58c>"

I've checked my available space in my home directory and have used 78GB and still have 21GB free to reach 100GB and my groupmate's page is fine. I didn't met this problem yesterday.

Can you help me with this? I attached a screenshot.

Best,
Zheyu Zhang

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Zheyu,

I'll go ahead and close this ticket if you're all set here.
Feel free to reach out again if you have any other issues in the future.

Best, 
Prasanth

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Zheyu,

Thank you for reaching out to RC, and I apologize for the inconvenience you've encountered.

It seems you are experiencing a "Disk quota exceeded" error because your usage has already reached 78GB, surpassing the allowed limit of 75GB. Even though you observe 21GB free, the quota is set at 75GB. For more detailed information on storage limits, you can refer to our storage documentation(https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/storage/discovery_storage.html).

Below are some suggestions to help you manage and clean your data:

1. Move runs to /scratch and important data should be backed up to /work
if your PI doesn’t have space in /work :
2. Clean the ~/ondemand logs directory occasionally 
3. Clear the ~/.conda directory: 
    1. Clean unused packages and caches: 
    `source activate <your environment>
    conda clean --all`
    This will not delete unused packages located in, say /shared/centos7/anaconda3/2021.11/pkgs
    but will remove packages in your local ~/.conda/pkgs folder.
    2. Clean unused conda environments:
    `conda env list`
    `conda env remove --name <name>
    OR
    conda env remove --prefix=<absolute-path-to-the-environment>`
    3. If you plan to create new conda environments in the future, the best would be use it with the `--prefix` command and install it in a permanent group storage share (under /work). For example:
    `conda create myenv --prefix=/work/<mygroup>/<mydirectory>`
    https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/create.html
4. Perform regular `du -sh *` 
    
    To figure out directory usage:
    
    1. Go to a compute node.
    
    2. Run: `du -shc /<directory>/*`
    
    3. du -h --max-depth=1 `/<directory>`
    
5. Clean `~/.cache` (make sure no processes are using it currently). 
6. Additional possible culprit is the `~/.singularity` directory which stores a copy of all pulled images: `singularity cache clean all`

I hope these suggestions assist you in resolving the issue. Please don't hesitate to let us know if you need further help.

Best,
Prasanth

Description : Hi,

I performed some computational experiments using the Discovery cluster and I was wondering if/where I can find information about the hardware of the compute nodes, to be published in the forthcoming paper. It would be great to know anything that’s available regarding processor specs or machine make/model).

I unfortunately don’t know the specific IDs for the compute nodes I used since I used a very large number of them, but all of them were on the short partition.

Thanks so much,
Connor Wilson

Hi Connor, 

Let me know if you're all set and I will close this ticket. 

Cheers,

Caplins :
Hi Connor, 

So for the number of cores per CPU, most of our nodes have 128 cores, but some have 2 128 core processes. If you're leaving that part of an sbatch script blank and just using the default number I believe you only use 1 core. 

If you have some jobids from past jobs you can take a look at the resources they used with: 

seff jobid

for example: seff 38349326 

The job above was just a test where I didn't include a --ntasks flab in the sbatch. Compared to when I gave it ntasks =2 in seff 38350649

Hope that helps!

Cheers, 
Serena

Caplins :
Hi Connor, 

The default RAM per CPU is 2 GBs. I'm not finding an easy answer for the default number of cores per cpu so let me ask around and get back to you. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Wilson :
reply from: wilson.conn@northeastern.edu

Hi Serena,

Thanks for your response. I just have a couple follow up questions—

  *   What is the default number of cores per cpu on the short partition?
  *   How is RAM allocated per job by default? The docs mention RAM limits per user, but I’m trying to understand per-job RAM allocation—is it allocated per cpu?

Thanks,
Connor

Caplins :
Hi Connor, 

Thank you for reaching out to RC with your query. You can find more information about machine features etc using the command 'sinfo'. For example to see the feature name for nodes on the short partition you could run this: sinfo -p short --Format=features,nodes,cpus,statecompact

There are many options for sinfo, we have some documentation here: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/slurm.html#cluster-and-node-states-sinfo

And some information on the node feature is found on our documentation here: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/hardware/hardware_overview.html

Hope that helps!

Cheers, 
Serena

Everything is working as expected. Professor gave the confirmation to close the ticket.

Sharma :
Hello Vladimir,

MongoDb compass and MySQL Workbench are both visual/GUI tools and I don't think we have them hosted on the discovery cluster. 

We will be updating the application so that you can connect to the MySQL and MongoDB instances from the Jupterlab notebook itself. Also, both the instances are up and running for now and can be connected through the terminal using the below commands:

To connect to MySQL through terminal:
# mysql -h mysql -u ALY2100 -p ALY2100
Enter <password> when promoted

To connect to MongoDB through terminal:
# module load mongo/4.2.8
# mongo  -u aly2100 -p <password> mongodb-00:2100/aly2100

I have shared the password for both the instances with you on teams. 

Thanks,
Paarthvi

Shapiro :
RITM Update: Paarthvi, it looks like both databases are there.

Question: is there a way to use the GUI tools, MySQL Workbench or MongoDB Compass somehow?

Sharma :
Hello Vladimir,

Apologies for the delay in response as I was on a break last week. Let me just confirm both the server and client side setup and get back to you.

Thanks,
Paarthvi

Shapiro :
RITM Update: Thank you,

Shapiro :
RITM Update: Hello Paarthvi,

Where do we stand with MySQL and MongoDB installation?Aplogies if these have been taken care of.

Sharma :
Hello Vladimir,

Please let me know if there are any questions or if anything is not working as per the expectation.

Thanks,
Paarthvi

Shapiro :
RITM Update: I did retest on 9/16th morning and there has been no change since my previous testing on 9/15th.

thank you very much :
2. The filesystem structure has changed: now it shows my home directory (vladisha) as if it were a Desktop instance. Before the fix, the filesystem looked like a Classroom setup with only 3 folders /staff, /students, /data. We need the setup to get us back to this Classroom state.
3. The problem I reported on Wednesday during the class when 3 students couldn't see their home directories may or may not be outstanding. After #2 is returned to the Classroom design, I'll ask the students to test #3

Sharma :
Hello Vladimir,

The new application with the functionality to download as PDF has been deployed in OOD. Please test it and let us know if everything works as expected.

Thanks,
Paarthvi

Shapiro :
RITM Update: Hello Paarthvi,

Yes, please try to install the PDF support. It usually requires TEX, XeLaTex, LaTEX or similar installed; these are OS dependent, you need to explore.

These packages should more than enough. I also assume that the peviously available MySQL and MongoDB support would be still available.

Best,

Sharma :
Hello Vladimir,

Could you please confirm if the PDF feature is required and what all python packages would be needed as we would have to deploy a containerized version of JupyterLab in this case. Please confirm if the below packages should be enough when deployed with the PDF feature or list any extra packages that might be required:

conda install numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter notebook scipy scikit-learn seaborn nb_conda
conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow keras
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
conda install -c plotly plotly=4.14.1
conda install -c plotly python-kaleido

Thanks,
Paarthvi

Sharma :
Hello Vladimir,

We have deployed the application and students should be able to view that in OOD. The login IDs for the users are given below and password would be the Northeastern password:

bhatnagar.ana
homkrachae.s
khandaker.r
kholostova.m
kim.youngja
liao.xinya
liu.kun3
moossa.m
nguyen.jenn
phan.minh2
tagliaferri.n
villadelgado.m

The PDF feature is not currently working as the last class did not require that.  In case you need the students to export the work as PDF we would have to make some changes to get that working. Please confirm if the below packages should be enough when deployed with the PDF feature:

    conda install numpy pandas matplotlib jupyter notebook scipy scikit-learn seaborn nb_conda
    conda install -c conda-forge tensorflow keras
    conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio cudatoolkit=10.2 -c pytorch
    conda install -c plotly plotly=4.14.1
    conda install -c plotly python-kaleido

Thanks,
Paarthvi

Shapiro :
RITM Update: Paarthvi, if you ask about ALY2100, the best would be resurrect the previous CPS ALY2100 which is not visible to me so I can't test it. It needs to have MySQL and MongDB connectors. Plus regular packages, like pandas, numpy, matpolotlib, etc. I need a JupyterLab version with debugging capabilities. If you install with Anaconda, all the packages will be there, I assume.

Will you get it done this morning?

Sharma :
Hello Vladimir,

We are working on this ticket. Could you please give us a list of what all data science packages would be required?

Thanks,
Paarthvi

Shapiro :
RITM Update: I start ALY2100 tomorrow and EAI6010 in 2 weeks. I filed requests for both.

Sharma :
Hello Vladimir,

There is a delay due to the long weekend. We are trying to process this as soon as possible. Could you please confirm if you need the OOD environment for tomorrow's class?

Thanks,
Paarthvi

Shapiro :
RITM Update: Just a note. My first class is tomorrow night,

Shapiro :
RITM Update: Hi Paarthvi, unfortunately I cannot see ALY2100s in OOD under Courses. Here is my view screenshot. It's likely that the older instance has all I need.

Sharma :
Hello Vladimir,

Thanks for reaching out to RC with your request. We are working on it and will get back.

1. There is older instance of ALY2100 present in OOD under courses. You can check it there.
2. Could you please list the packages that you would need pre-installed? Also, when you say the class needs MySQL and MongoDB, would you need mysql-connector-python package to connect your python code to the database?

Thanks,
Paarthvi

Shapiro :
RITM Update: It seems that I posted by mistake a couple of comments related to ALY2100 to the other incident related to EAI6010. To clarify, I need both. Each have different specs.

Shapiro :
RITM Update: ...and more. This class need MongoDB and MySQL. A suggestion: there must have been an instance "ALY 2100" before; I know that other instructors have used it. But I can't see among the available ones. Can you clarify?

Shapiro :
RITM Update: An update: the program management split the MERGED into two separate sections ALY2100.90423 and ALY2100.90424. This shouldn't affect the students listed in the spreadsheet I submitted. They should all be able to access the resource created.

Shapiro :
RITM Update: Forgot to mention that it has to be a Jupyter Notebook/Lab with debugging capabilities enabled.

Subject: Discovery - Login Node Use Warning (malik.gi)


Dear malik.gi,

We have noticed that you're running CPU-intensive processes on one of the login nodes(login-01), as detailed below.

/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/user.slice/user-1825520797.slice:
├─session-48721.scope
│ ├─  4508 /shared/centos7/miniconda3/2020-09/bin/python /shared/centos7/miniconda3/2020-09/bin/conda install -c conda-forge pytorch-gpu

  ├─249650 sshd: malik.gi [priv
  ├─249659 sshd: malik.gi@pts/10
  └─249660 -bash


CPU usage: 38%
You should not use the login node for CPU intensive activities, as this can impact the performance of this node for all cluster users.
Also, It will not give you the best performance for the tasks you are trying to do. Please reference our documentation for more information: Next steps<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/index.html>.

If you are trying to run a job, you should move to a compute node. You can do this interactively using the srun command or non-interactively using sbatch command. Please see our documentation on how to do this: Using sbatch<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/sbatch.html>; Using srun<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/srun.html>.

If you are trying to transfer data, we have a dedicated transfer node that you should use. Please see our documentation on transferring data for more information: Transferring Data<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html>.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, simply reply to this email or book a consultation with us using the link on our Consultation page<https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/>.

Description : Hi,

I am in the process of analyzing a very large set of RNA sequencing data using

  *   nanopolish eventalign
  *   nanocompore eventalign collapse

 Even with the long partition, I am unable to process individual sequencing runs, as 5 days are not long enough, even with ntasks = 128.

We have been struggling with this for months, and it is the last piece of a publication needed for submission ASAP.

Would it be possible to extend the 5-day limit, or do you have any other suggestions to accomplish this task?

Thanks,

Hi Caroline, 

I haven't heard back from you in quite a while. Please reach out again in the future if you want us to reserve a few machines for you for a few weeks so you can run your jobs. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Caplins :
Hi Caroline, 

So sorry for the delay in getting back to you. We have been very busy with the start of the semester. I have reviewed your scripts and the nanocompore manual, and have a few suggestions: have you tried increasing the number of cores for the EAcollapse step? I see you're using 128 for the EventAlign step. 

I haven't found any suggestion that nanocompore can be run across multiple nodes but that could also be tested, perhaps in a smaller dataset to compare it's efficiency. 

If those two suggestions don't work or you have tried them already. Then I recommend us setting up a reservation so you can run jobs for a longer time. Perhaps two weeks would be sufficient? Let me know how you want to proceed and I can set up a reservation for you. 

Do you know how many jobs you will be needing to run?

Cheers, 
Serena

Caplins :
Hi Caroline, 

Thank you so much for the scripts. I am going over them now. Do you mind also providing jobids from past jobs that you've been running?

Also curious if you have a sense of how much longer you think the jobs need to run for? Would two weeks work? or do you need more than that?

Cheers,
Serena

McCormick :
reply from: mccormick.ca@northeastern.edu

Hi Serena,

Thanks so much for getting back to me. I have attached the sbatch script(s) I have been using to process nanopolish and nanocompore. They can be easily combined, but due to timeout, I had to separate them.

Let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Caroline, 

Do you mind sharing your sbatch script for these runs or past jobids? We can first work on making sure your code is as optimized as possible. And then if you're still needing additional time we can get something set up for to get your data processed.

I appreciate your help!

Hi Rue,

Great. I've copied it to your home under ondemand/dev.

All you need to do now is go to the Open OnDemand app and follow the steps below https://ood.discovery.neu.edu/pun/sys/dashboard

1. Along the top you will see a tab called "Develop". Select "My SandBox Apps"
2. Then you should see an app called EAI6010 JupyterLab. Click the blue square that says "Launch EAI6010 JupyterLab"
3. Once the launch page opens you will be asked for a directory. Please enter your home directory: /home/lee.chieh-

If you leave the directory blank it will give you an error.

Please let me know if you have any questions. You will also likely need copies of the class material (Module 1 for example). Let me know if you need that and I can copy it to your home for you.

Cheers,
Serena

Hi Rue Lee,

Thank you fro contacting RC. As Greg said there is a snag with adding you to the unix group so you can see the courses tab.

I have been in communication with the Professor about this issue. Is it okay if I make a copy of the course app in your home directory? You can then launch it in the Open on Demand app through the "Develop" tab. I can tell you more about how to do that once I have your permission to copy it to your home directory.

Thank you,
Serena

hello rue lee-

thank you for reaching out to RC !

your account ran into a snag on our side, which
we have a patch that we mean to apply later today.

in short, you are the only person in a course on
discovery this term who has both a staff account
and a student account, which confused some of
the codes we run.

we will be putting this fix into production later
today (i hope) and i'll let you know when that is
all set.

apologies for the delay
[greg]

Hi Rue Lee,

Try now? If it doesn't work this time maybe we can do a quick teams call to get everything sorted out. But I think it should be good now.

Hi Rue,

Great. I've copied it to your home under ondemand/dev.

All you need to do now is go to the Open OnDemand app and follow the steps below https://ood.discovery.neu.edu/pun/sys/dashboard

1. Along the top you will see a tab called "Develop". Select "My SandBox Apps"
2. Then you should see an app called EAI6010 JupyterLab. Click the blue square that says "Launch EAI6010 JupyterLab"
3. Once the launch page opens you will be asked for a directory. Please enter your home directory: /home/lee.chieh-

If you leave the directory blank it will give you an error.

Please let me know if you have any questions. You will also likely need copies of the class material (Module 1 for example). Let me know if you need that and I can copy it to your home for you.

Cheers,
Serena

Hi Rue Lee,

Thank you fro contacting RC. As Greg said there is a snag with adding you to the unix group so you can see the courses tab.

I have been in communication with the Professor about this issue. Is it okay if I make a copy of the course app in your home directory? You can then launch it in the Open on Demand app through the "Develop" tab. I can tell you more about how to do that once I have your permission to copy it to your home directory.

Thank you,
Serena

thank you for reaching out to RC !

your account ran into a snag on our side, which
we have a patch that we mean to apply later today.

in short, you are the only person in a course on
discovery this term who has both a staff account

the codes we run.

we will be putting this fix into production later
today (i hope) and i'll let you know when that is

Description : Dear RC Help,

My name is Bernardo Zubillaga, a postdoc at Northeastern working with Prof. Michele Di Pierro.

I tried to install the a package inside a Jupyter notebook which I opened in the Dashboard, but it didn’t work.
It works if I attempt to install it using on a notebook using Google Colab, for example, but not in Dashboard.
(Please see below)

What can I do to get this to work in Dashboard?

Thanks.

Bernardo.

Here is what I get when I attempt to install it using a Google Colab notebook:

Dear Joseph,
Thank you for your reply. You explained it in detail and now I have a better understanding! I also deleted some unnecessary files in my home and scratch directories. We can close this ticket then.

Cooke :
Hello Emad,

I forgot to add, /datasets is a read only directory where we have stored commonly used dataset and it will have no effect on your account or quota. My apologies on forgetting to add that to the initial message.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Emad,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. The slowness you might be experiencing yesterday could be related to a user's workflow and increased latency on the system because others noticed similar behavior yesterday too. 

If you want to check and see what files you have in your home directory, you can run the following:

du -shc .[^.]* * and that will show you all the files and directories in ~ and with their size. 

You can read more about best practices for your $HOME in https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/homequota.html.

Thank you,

Joseph

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Emma,

Upon reviewing the GitHub repository for project, we found that it relies on two main dependencies: FSL and Freesurfer. Both are available as modules in discovery. However, we observed that the code is written in Python 2, an older version that may pose compatibility challenges.

You have the option to use our provided Python module (python/2.7.15) or create a conda environment with an older Python version yourself. Please be mindful of compatibility with certain libraries, as not all may work with Python 2. For instance, you would need to use a NumPy version older than 1.15.0 since newer versions require Python 3. Care must also be taken when installing other libraries, as newer versions may not be compatible with Python 2.

Given that the code is relatively small, we recommend updating it to Python 3 syntax. Most required modifications appear to be syntactical, so the transition should be feasible.

Please let us know if you need any assistance with this process or have further questions.

Best,
Prasanth

Chheda :
Hello Benjamin,

Once you login to OOD, click on Clusters -> Discover Shell Access. Once you are inside the terminal, type this command 'du -sh /home/b.batorsky/' 
(The output may take some time) This command will give you the space you have utilized from your 75 gb quota of /home. You can then type 'ls' command which will list down all the files which are there in your /home. You can then review and remove/delete files which are no longer in use for you. Please let me know if you need any further help.

Best,
Keval

b.batorsky (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
reply from: b.batorsky@northeastern.edu

Thank you, Keval.  How do I check my quota? I can’t start jupyter lab, so I can’t run jupyter lab clean.  I’m surprised I’ve hit my limit as it was working a few weeks ago, which was the last time I would have added files/installed packages.

Chheda :
Hello Benjamin,

The "disk quota exceeded" error you're encountering typically indicates that you have reached the storage limit for your /home directory where you are trying to save or load files. This can happen in JupyterLab or any other environment where you interact with files.

Here are a few steps you can take to address this issue:

Check Your Quota: Every discovery user has a 75 Gb of quota in their /home work directory. Please check your disk space. 

Clear Unneeded Files: If you have any large or unnecessary files in your directory, consider deleting or moving them to free up space.

Delete Temporary Files: If the script you are running on your Jupyter lab notebook generates temporary files, I would recommend you to clean up these up by restarting your JupyterLab kernel or by running a command like "jupyter lab clean"

Please let me know if these methods worked for you

Best,
Keval

Do you have any ideas about how this error is going?

Cooke :
Hello Deng,

You are welcome for the help. 

I didn't see any python jobs launch on login-00 when I ran the script. I did have a perl process running but nowhere near the cpu usage your tasks is running at currently on login-00.

How are you submitting the array job? Are you using

sbatch job_array_1.sh 

to submit the job?

The short running jobs I think are okay for the launching but I didn't experience those. 

I am not sure if increasing the number of cpus would change the behavior. What does changing the number of cpus in the submission script change? Doesn't Schrodinger get the CPU usage from the IFD submission line? I reduced it to one because running the launch.sh script doesn't need much cpu power to submit the actual job.

Thank you,

Joseph

LI :
reply from: li.den@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

Thanks very much for your help.

I just tried the script. I found that when the jobs started, they still needed to use login node resources to run some short-time jobs such as "python3, perl". These short-time jobs usually end within seconds.
I also attached a screenshot here.

The difference from the script you provided is that I required 6 cpus in sbatch file with "#SBATCH --ntasks=6".

Does it matter for this condition?

Thanks again for your help.

Best regards

Cooke :
Hello Deng,

Thank you for that information and thank you for your patiences in this. I got a setup running that doesn't launch anything on the login node by including another script and modifying your job array script. I am going to paste the two here but if you would like I can attach them to the ticket and we can talk about the changes here more.

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=complex_array_job
#SBATCH --partition=short
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --output=out_%A_%a.out
#SBATCH --error=err_%A_%a.err
#SBATCH --array=88-91%4
#SBATCH --time=00:30:00

# Load your necessary module(s) here, if any
module load schrodinger/2022-3

# Change to the directory of the job
cd complex_individual_$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID

# Run the job, remember not to use -HOST localhost as it will use the login resource
./launch.sh


I reduced the time here because this script only launches the jobs and it doesn't have to stay running so it is a relatively short script. I also reduced the number of tasks because it was only launching the jobs and the CPUS are defined in your actual Schrodinger call line.

You can add your echo statements back in if you would like but you do not need to generate ssh keys or do anything like that in order to have them launch. 

I also added the %4 to the --array line since we are launching the four tasks at once. Note, you can only have 50 running jobs on Discovery so if you launch more than that, the scheduler will have them in the queue but not have them running so you can adjust this parameter to fit the number of jobs each of the arrays will launch.


The launch.sh script I have in every subdirectory is:

#!/bin/bash

"${SCHRODINGER}/ifd" -NGLIDECPU 15 -NPRIMECPU 15 complex_individual_glycan.inp -HOST localhost -SUBHOST discovery-general -TMPLAUNCHDIR -WAIT


You can change the sub-host back to your particular one from your hostfile but I just switched to the discovery-general subhost. I also switched HOST to localhost because they are launching on the compute nodes so that is the localhost in those cases. 

Make sure you chmod 755 your launch.sh script so it will actually be executable. 

I ran the job and nothing appeared on the login-00 node with these modifications so it should be okay to try out this setup. Please let me know if you have any questions or if you want to talk about any of the changes.

Thank you,

Joseph

LI :
reply from: li.den@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

I sent you 4 job examples. Usually, I run about 10 jobs in the meantime. However, the 10 jobs will launch about 50 sub-jobs. The time will depend on the case by case, usually 5 to 20 hours.

I heard back from Schroginger and they supplied the following documentation https://support.schrodinger.com/s/article/1571?name=1571 for how to start a series of IFD simulations. I want to do some testing and monitor the login node to make sure it doesn't see a load.

Hi Joseph,

I just killed all my jobs. I submitted jobs using an array job with the script below.
And there are strange things in my account when I open the terminal in OOD. I found my account will launch a huge number of "conda" commands. I have no idea why. I am not sure if it is because I recently setup an anaconda environment in my discovery account.

Hello Deng,

I am reaching out because there were a large number of Schrodinger jobs launching on the login node with your username. I was wondering if you could share how you are launching them and the type of jobs you are running so we can get this sorted out so they run on the compute nodes.

Thank you,

Joseph

Description : Hello,
Could you please help me with this UCX error? I am running some simulation on multiple cores and multiple nodes. Even once the simulation is finished, my job is not finished. I am attaching herewith log error and job script files. Thanks.
Sincerely,
Deepak

Caplins :
@Joshi, Manasvita sounds good I will let them know if this is a persistent issue. d0126 and d0127 have been running fine lately as far as I can tell.

m.joshi (Work notes) :
@Caplins, Serena, in the past excluding the node all together has worked for users. So you may want to suggest to him to add the following to his jobsh file if the error persists:

#SBATCH --exclude=d1026

Caplins :
Hi Deepak, 

Have you run into a UCX error since this one? It looks like it may have happened due to a node failure on d0127 that happened around the same time that your job was running. This job was on d0127 and d0126. 

Otherwise your code looks to be in order. Let me know if this has continues to happen and I'll look into it closer. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Caplins :
Hi Deepak, 

Apologies for taking so long to get back to you. I just wanted you to know that I am working on this issue and will hopefully have more information for you later this week. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Description : Hello,

We are working on some calculations to go in a proposal. The deadline is next week, so somewhat time sensitive.

Simon Samuroff is a postdoc in the group and is running these jobs on Discovery. He's currently using the short​ partition. (We expect the jobs to take about 24 hours once they start.) Is there a way to lookup what expected queue times are at the moment? We are trying to plan for what will be possible to get done before the deadline.

Similarly, are there other queues we should consider? I have been meaning to set-up a PI-specific partition (I have some funds for this), but I would imagine we wouldn't be able to get that going in time?

Thanks!
Jonathan

Thank you,

Blazek :
reply from: j.blazek@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

Is it possible to extend the reservation through the end of the week? I think we have one more round of jobs to submit. Otherwise, I think we are good.

just to avoid any confusion.) :

Best,
Jonathan

Cooke :
Hello Jonathan,

I am reaching out to see if you have any other questions or if I can resolve this ticket. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Jonathan,

Sorry about the confusion and I am not sure why Simon cannot see the ticket. If Simon responds to the email it should forward the email to the ticket and they should also be getting the responses via email also. 

As for the error message, the nodes that were put into the reservation might not have a total of 64 cores per node. I just checked and they have 56 cores per node. Could you reduce the number of ntasks to 56 for these jobs or since this is in a reservation you can use more than 2 nodes for the jobs to get up to the 128 cores that the sbatch job is trying to run. Could you have Simon try one of these?

Again, sorry for the confusion. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Blazek :
Also, when Simon clicks on "Take me to the incident" link, it goes to a "Record not Found" page

Blazek :
Hello. I just heard from Simon about this. When he submits a job:

#!/bin/bash 
#SBATCH --job-name=lsst_Y3IA_TATT_wCDM_1x2pt
#SBATCH -N 2
#SBATCH --ntasks-per-node=64
#SBATCH --time=24:00:00
#SBATCH --partition=reservation
#SBATCH --reservation=Samuroff

he gets the following error:

sbatch: error: CPU count per node can not be satisfied
sbatch: error: Batch job submission failed: Requested node configuration is not available

Cooke :
Hello Jonathan,

I only see one reply so no duplicates came through.

You are welcome and absolutely we can include Simon on the ticket. I just have added him to the watchlist so he should be able to view the ticket from the tech portal and receive email updates on it. 

Simon will be able to get the jobs running on the reservation from this morning so that should help with the 5-10 jobs that you have to get done for the deadline. Let me know if you have any other questions. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Blazek :
[Apologies if this is a duplicate posting. I have been having trouble replying here, probably due to a slow connection.]

this is very helpful! :

Is it possible to include Simon Samuroff (s.samuroff@northeastern.edu) in this thread. He knows the details of the jobs being submitted and will be the one to actually submit under this reservation.

In short, these are monte carlo markov chain calculations with some internal parallelization. We hope to run 5-10 such jobs over the next couple of days.

Cooke :
Hello Jonathan,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. You can use some slurm commands to see what the usage of the cluster is at the given time such as 

sinfo -p short 

to see what nodes are currently available, used or partially used. 

Once you have the job submitted, you can see the estimated time before it starts with 

scontrol show jobid -d <job-id>

where you can get the job-id from

squeue -u $USER

For the 24 hour limit, the short partition is the only one that gives you that time without getting access to the long partition. The other partitions have shorter time limits on them. 

What are you trying to run and what type of resources are you utilizing? It looks like you are trying to run 128 core jobs from the ones you have currently submitted. 

I created a reservation because of your deadline to help get the jobs running using 6 nodes from the short partition for the next 2 days. To submit jobs to this reservation please include the following in the sbatch submission:

#SBATCH --partition=reservation
#SBATCH --reservation=Samuroff

You can still have jobs submitted to short as well but the reservation will just get jobs running faster.

Also all tickets start off as low-priority when they are submitted and we work on them as they come in. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Blazek :
I just wanted to add that this is high-priority, as it is impacting my work. I'm not sure how it got the "low priority" tag below.

Hi Keval,

I am still getting node failure error with different simulations and nodes. These are the most recent errors. I have observed that node failure error occured at different nodes at the same time. Maybe a general failure occurs at that moment in the cluster? Does other users also have this problem?

Chheda :
Hello Ugur,

The nodes which were causing the node failure issue were addressed in the maintenance which happened yesterday. I request you to submit a job and let me know if the issue still persists.

Best,
Keval

Kokal :
Hi Keval,

Thank you for your help and time.

I am still getting node failure error:
                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 
slurmstepd: error: *** JOB 37337911 ON d0118 CANCELLED AT 2023-07-08T04:44:12 DUE TO NODE FAILURE, SEE SLURMCTLD LOG FOR DETAILS ***

Is this a problem caused by the simulations or does a problem occur at the node? How can I solve this problem.

Best,
Uğur

Chheda :
Hello Ugur,

The node failure issue will be addressed shortly and you will no longer face similar issue while running your jobs.

Best,
Keval

Phaltankar :
Hello Ugur,

Thank you for your response. We are checking this issue and will update you as soon as possible.

Thanks,

reply from: kokal.u@northeastern.edu

Hi Vrushali,

It seems that there is no specific time at which the runs fail. I ran the same simulations a couple of times and encountered node fails at different time steps. Interestingly, during the third or fourth attempt, the same simulations ran smoothly and completed.

It doesn't seem to be related with the simulation files. I have encountered same node fail problem in completely different simulation files.

Yesterday I built and ran a new simulation model with Job ID: 37172868, nodes: d[0044-0045], however after running about 7 hours the simulation failed with node fail error.

Thank you for your time and help.

Best regards
Ugur Kokal

Description : Dear,
I've been using the cluster for my research related work in deep learning for autonomous vehicles. I'm a grad student in robotics program.

Whenever i try to access the A100 gpu in the cluster i'm never able to use it. is there a reason for this?

best,
Anush

Pillai :
Hi Anush,

Since I haven't received any updates from you in the past few days, I'm considering closing the ticket. 
If you require further assistance, please feel free to reopen the ticket by replying to it.

Regards,
Girish Pillai

Pillai :
Hi Anush,

Thanks for reaching out to Research Computing. 

Could you please share the command you are using to acquire the resources?

When you mention not receiving the resource, are you referring to extended wait times, or is it that you never acquire the resource even after waiting for an extended period?

The a100s are the latest and fastest GPUs available in the shared GPU partition, which has led to significant usage by researchers. As a result, the scheduler (SLURM) queues jobs to efficiently allocate these shared resources among users.

I suggest waiting for a while or adjusting the resource parameters in your commands to see if that enables you to secure the resource.

Do let me know if you have any other question.

Schedule a consultation if you need further help:

Subject: Re: Research computing and storage
Hi Gene,

Thank you for reaching out. You are right, every PI can get up to 35TB of RC storage across our different tiers (high performant storage, archival etc), free of charge.

If you have not done so yet, kindly submit a RC storage request<https://bit.ly/NURC-NewStorage> and we will be in touch shortly after to provision the storage space and help with the data transfer. Choose ‘yes’ for cluster access if you need to access the data from the cluster nodes (to do analysis using Discovery for example). If this is just for archival purposes, chose ‘archival’ under usage.

We use Globus to do data transfers so it might be good to create an account if you do not have one. You can read more about how to create a Globus account here<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/globus.html>.

Best,
Raphael

Hi Raphael,
Dave Kaeli suggested that I reach out to you.  I am looking to get central storage for my research data. Currently, I use a NAS drive in my lab (about 10TB I think). I believe that NU provides 35T free to faculty. Please advise what I need to do to start the process to get the drive access and transfer my data.
Thanks and best,

I think the permissions issues are resolved so I am closing this ticket. I look forward to our consultation this afternoon on unzipping and anything else you need assistance with.

Hi Heather, 

Yes it looks like you don't have read privileges on SuperResolutionData or it's sub folders. I changed it for you so it should work now. Please let us know if all is good.

Description : Dear Team,

I’m working with Professor Bruce Maxwell in the Super Resolution team. I’m trying to execute computer Vision networks for which GPU is timing out in the middle of execution. I’ve already tried running different jobs 4 times which all failed with the same issue, can be seen from my jobs history. My code can run in parallel on 8 GPUs. Could you please give me these so that I can get my results please.


Thank you,

Srijha:

Cuda 11.8 is available on VSCode OOD now.

Robinson :
This is duplicate from Team message for the record.

It should all save into a single file. 

As shown on the documentation:

Save state dict:

checkpoint_path = 'checkpoint.pth'
state = {'epoch': epoch + 1,         
        'state_dict': net.state_dict(),         
        'optimizer': optimizer.state_dict()}

torch.save(state, checkpoint_path)


Or, if you just want the model (not to continue training):


Saving the Entire Model

model_path = 'model.pth'
torch.save(net, model_path)

Then, load the dictionary and assign the values to continue training:


Load, keep training

codecheckpoint = torch.load(checkpoint_path)
net.load_state_dict(checkpoint['state_dict'])
optimizer.load_state_dict(checkpoint['optimizer'])
epoch = checkpoint['epoch']

Or just load the entire model (second snippet above):


Entire model

loaded_model = torch.load(model_path)


Source: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/checkpointing.html#saving-a-pytorch-model

Thammareddy :
reply from: thammareddy.s@northeastern.edu

Hi Joe,

Thank you for looking into this and sharing pytorch checkpoints information, I understand what you mean, I tried to look through where my code is saving the state dictionary and optimizer, this code is split into other files.

I have the checkpoints saved in the models folder as below, (swinir_sr_classical_patch48_x2 folder has the training run information)
/scratch/thammareddy.s/SuperResolution/KAIR/superresolution/swinir_sr_classical_patch48_x2/models

[A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated]
And this is where my training ended:
[A table with numbers and letters  Description automatically generated]

Would I be able to resume training using the files above?

In the next run, I wish to conclude training at 1500 epochs

Best,

Robinson :
Greetings Srijha:

Recalling our conversation on teams, you do have most of what you need. At line 205 of train_main_psnr.py, you have the call to save the model.

This works if you only want to save the model to do testing after. However, if you want to continue training, you have to save your optimizer, epoch number (for bookkeeping), and network (state dictionary).  See the example and explanation provided on our RTD, https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/checkpointing.html#saving-a-pytorch-model (this provides all the info you need to save and load, and to continue training. 

Does this make sense?

Best regards,
Joe

Hi Team,

This is an urgent request please. Could you please help me resume from pytorch check points?

Thank you,
Srijha

reply from: thammareddy.s@northeastern.edu

Dear Team,

I have checkpoints from two jobs I ran and wish to resume my progress.

I’m using torchrun commands to execute my model and my code is restarting the training instead of resuming from checkpoints. Could you help me fix this please?

Attaching my code files.

Commands I use to run:
# 001 Classical Image SR (middle size)
Torchrun --nproc_per_node=1 --master_port=1234 main_train_psnr.py --opt options/swinir/train_swinir_sr_classical.json  --dist True

# 002 Lightweight Image SR (small size)
Torchrun --nproc_per_node=1 --master_port=1234 main_train_psnr.py --opt options/swinir/train_swinir_sr_lightweight.json  --dist True

Note: cannot use python -m torch.distributed.launch due to local rank error

Please do let me know if you need any other details.

Thank you!
Srijha

Robinson :
Srijha,

We can help with this.

Did you see our documentation on saving and loading PyTorch models, https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/checkpointing.html#saving-a-pytorch-model

If you share the code and give a little information about how (file name, line number) you are trying to do this, I will look it over.

Also, we can meet on Teams for a video chat if that helps, too.

Best regards,
Joe

If adding hours will take time, could you or someone help look at my code please.

I have checkpoints saved for two models that I can resume from. I’m not able to figure out how to do this.

Hi Joseph

It is a research class cs8674. I work with Professor Bruce Maxwell in the super resolution team. I’m hoping 24 hours.

Best,

Cooke :
Hello Srijha,

Is this for a class? If so, what class is it? How long are you thinking the training is going to take if the current time limit isn't enough on the gpu partition? 

Thank you,

Joseph

Thammareddy :
reply from: thammareddy.s@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph

Thank you for getting back to me .

I’m checkpointing and can only run code with the torchrun command
But unable to resume training because torchrun isnt taking resume from checkpoint.

This is the final week of classes for Summer and I really need help please.

Is there anyway you could give me more time on the gpu? This will greatly gelp me get results and showcase them this week.

I’d be greatful if someone can look at my code and get training to resume from checkpoints too, but this would be time consuming too since I dont have much time to finish all of the jobs with this approach right now (I have 5 jobs to execute)

So, for now, can you let me request more gpu hours please

Best,
Srijha

Cooke :
@Robinson, Joe This was the ticket I was talking to you about yesterday. Thank you!!

Cooke :
Hello Srijha,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. Sorry for the delay in responding to your inquiry. 

If you want us to look at your code for the possibility of checkpointing that is something we can assist with.  This way  you can run multiple jobs on the gpu partition for it to fit under the time limit for the partition. 

Also if you want to use multiple GPUs, we have the multiGPU partition which you have to submit a ticket to request evaluation for the partition. It is a two step process. You will request testing access which we request you to benchmark your code on multiple GPUs to see how it scales and then based on the results we will grant you access. Here is the ticket (https://bit.ly/NURC-PartitionAccess).

Please let me know if you have any other questions. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Description : Hi-

I have a couple of questions about running a long job. I'm attempting to fit a pytorch model that I estimate will take approximately 48 hours of run time to complete. Since I can't allocate a block of time that long, I presume I need to break it into shorter, sequential sessions, eg of 1 hour each. What is the best way to schedule this? My python code can take care of checkpointing and picking up where it left off, so I can call the same fit.py script each time, but I'm not sure what I should use to run the batch code repeatedly. I can't have it run every hour, because of course it takes an uncertain amount of time for the scheduler to assign the node. This must be a fairly standard problem, but I can't figure out what the standard answer is, sorry!

Also, along those lines, I was trying to use an a100 gpu to run this, since it's 10x faster than the others I've tried. But while the first time I requested a 1-hour (interactive) session it was allocated fairly quickly, the subsequent times it hasn't been allocated despite waiting a number of hours. Am I doing something wrong, or are these gpu's in too high demand? Is there another quick gpu I could be using, or some other strategy I should pursue?

Thanks very much! And btw, if anything is better discussed via email, zoom, or phone, my contact information is

Caplins :
Good to hear. Thanks again for reaching out with this request. Feel free to contact us again if anything else come up!

Beauchamp :
Seems to work fine. Thanks for all the help!

Caplins :
Hi Nick, 

Yes that is correct! Let us know how that works for you. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Beauchamp :
Ok, happy to try to change it to suit best practices. As I understand it, that would mean deleting from my bash file the dependency line "#SBATCH --dependency=singleton", and instead just executing it once with something like "sbatch --array=1-3%1 mybash.bash". The "--array=1-3%1" option would create three identical tasks (similar to executing the bash file three times), but the "%1" part would make sure that only one task executes at a time. I know I may have some of the terminology wrong, but is that basically correct?

Caplins :
Hi Nick, 

We also have documentation on checkpointing that you may or may not have seen. There are ML examples including one for pytorch https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/checkpointing.html#

Greg has also informed me that using a slurm array would be preferable to the dependency flag and that is what our documentation suggests above. But totally up to you (listen to Greg). 

Have a good one!

Cheers, 
Serena

Beauchamp :
Thanks for the reply. That matches what my own googling found. Because it's just repeated runs of the same script, I ended up instead using "#SBATCH --dependency=singleton", which means that repeated calls of the same .bash script automatically queue them up in a row, each waiting for the previous to finish before running, without need to capture the jobid of the previous one. Thanks for the help, and thanks to Greg for creating the work directory!

Shomo :
@Caplins, Serena if we can, i think it is cleaner to promote the recursive-job to the dependent-job strategy.  ie, the job re-submits itself (and exits early if it is complete). lmk if that does not make sense (i am under-caffeinated at present).

Caplins :
Hi Nick, 

Thank you for reaching out to RC with this request and for the very clear description of the problem. 

I think the best way to schedule these jobs would be with the dependency flag in your sbatch script.  As I'm sure you know once you submit a job to slurm it assigns it a jobid. You can use that jobid to initiate when the next job will start. So your second job will start dependent on when the first job finishes. 

Here's an example of using the dependency flag. Where the job being run here will start after the jobid provided finishes:

#SBATCH --dependency=after:jobid

And here is more documentation for other options of using dependencies https://hpc.nih.gov/docs/job_dependencies.html

Does that sound like something that would work for you?

Cheers, 
Serena

Description : Hello,
My name is Jill Trazino and I am a student. I was recently working on a homework assignment using the Discovery web portal. I was writing a script using Vim. I had clicked away from my window and them clicked back, only to realize that Vim  wasn't responding. I closed out my window and tried to login to discovery again. I was met with an error stating, "ssh: connect to host login-00.discovery.neu.edu port 22:connection refused Your connection to the remote server has been terminated."

Caplins :
Hi Jill, 

Can you login via ssh from a terminal (on Mac) or by using mobaxterm or putty on a PC? It looks like the OOD Discovery portal is operating fine now (though please let me know if you're still seeing the same error message), but in case something happens where you lose your connection again you can log in without using the web portal. 

There appears to have been a network issue (I also saw this error around 8:20-8:30 PM on Tuesday. However, the problem was just with the web portal/OOD app. The system is working properly now so hopefully this wont disrupt your work again. 

Please see our documentation on logging in through the terminal: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/gettingstarted/index.html

Hi Yiyu,

You will have access to Discovery till your sponsorship for the account is valid. A mail will be sent your sponsor when your sponsorship term nears its end. At that time if you sponsor chooses not to renew your account you will loose access to Discovery.

Hello Sheridan,

I am going to resolve this ticket since we haven't heard back from you in a bit. If you have any other questions please reach out to Research Computing at the following links: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/welcome/gettinghelp.html

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Sheridan,

You are welcome! Yes, the k40 and k80 gpus only go to cuda 11.4 while your environment uses a newer version of cuda. So from the documentation page on gpus (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/runningjobs/workingwithgpus.html), these include the p100s, both styles of v100s, the t4 and the a100s and in terms of newness, it is the same order as I listed. 

If you need at least 24 G of video ram, it would mean you need either the v100-pcie or the v100-sxm2 cards or one of the a100 cards and they all support the version of CUDA you are running. 

You would request them with just changing the gres statement liks:

#SBATCH --gres=gpu:v100-sxm2:1 

for sbatch jobs or 

--gres=gpu:v100-sxm2:1 

for interactive srun jobs. 

Do you have any other questions that I can assist with?

Cooke :
Hello Sheridan,

No problem on the follow up and just wanted to make sure things were working. What version of PyTorch and Cuda are you using? Cuda 11.4 is the last version that works on the K40 and K80 GPUs. You might want to try the p100 and greater GPUs to see if you can get it working. Please let me know if that works to solve it and we can go from there.

Thank you,

Feucht :
reply from: feucht.s@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

Thanks for following up! I was able to get most things installed but I got stuck because I might have updated things too much --

    Found GPU0 Tesla K40m which is of cuda capability 3.5.
    PyTorch no longer supports this GPU because it is too old.
    The minimum cuda capability supported by this library is 3.7.

I might have to downgrade to some in-between PyTorch version? I can also try to look into that.

Thanks,

Hello Sheridan,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. We can use higher versions of python with the use of Anaconda. Could you please try the following:

srun --pty /bin/bash
module load anaconda3/2022.05
conda create -n <name_of_env> python=3.11 -y

where <name_of_env> is your choice and we can specify to use python 3.11. 

We can activate that environment with:

source activate <name_of_env>

Then I checked with

conda list | grep openssl 

and I see 

openssl                   3.0.10               h7f8727e_2  

is installed in the environment. Can you see if your python packages will install in this environment?

Description : Hello there,

This is Yanli Liu, a fourth-year Econ PhD candidate in the Econ Department. I am writing to inquire about the research computing services provided by your platform.

I am currently working on a project that involves evaluating the impact of reputation systems on consumer welfare in digital platforms. However, the dataset I am working with is too large for my laptop to handle regression analysis efficiently. I was wondering if there is any way I could coordinate with you to complete my research. By the way, I am using Stata as the software for my coding.

I look forward to your reply!

Best regards,
Yanli

Hello Yanli,

Since we haven't heard back from you I am going to resolve this ticket. If you have any other questions please reach out to Research Computing at the following links: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/welcome/gettinghelp.html

Thank you,

Hello Yanli,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. In order to use the Discovery platform you need to have a faculty sponsor for you to obtain an account. You can submit a ticket here (https://bit.ly/NURC-AccessRequest) for your Discovery account. We have documentation here (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/#_ga=2.199975723.428568640.1689589968-1244983250.1679945103) on how to login to Discovery through ssh and through our instance of Open OnDemand where you can run GUI applications. We also have past training sessions recorded that you can view that might be helpful too (https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/training/). 

Thank you for letting me know that you use Stata as your software package for your coding because we have a version of Stata on Open OnDemand so that might be a good starting point for you. 

You can also schedule 1:1 consultations (https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/) with a Research Computing staff member to help walk you through what we do and what Discovery has to offer for research as well. 

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Thank you,

Joseph

Hi it did reach me but I wasn’t able to access discovery the last couple of days because of the power outage… I’ll copy it over now. But also I’m submitting this request on behalf of Dr. Rouhanifard, the scripts are mine and you’ve already given me long partition access.

Subject: discovery cluster notice

hello s.knight-

i am trying to track down the genesis
for a bunch of git commands that folks
seem to be leaving abandoned on the login
nodes recently.

do you run 'vscode' or such against the login
nodes or run any plugins that you think may
be spawing these processes ?

here's an example from just now from login-01.

```
login-01: ps U s.knight

   PID TTY      STAT   TIME COMMAND
  2424 ?        D      4:54 git status -z -uall
 77502 ?        D      1:13 git status -z -uall
192198 ?        D      1:31 git status -z -uall
196963 ?        D      4:37 git status -z -uall
256722 ?        D      1:03 git status -z -uall
```

nothing urgent here, but i would like to track
this down, as all those git commands in uniterruptible
sleep create a "phantom load" on the server (which
can lead to page-a-human scenarios).

thank you for any pointers
&& happy computing !

Hi Samsun, 

You can get on a compute node with the command srun. For example:

srun --pty /bin/bash 

Will get you 4 hours on one node on the short partition. See more here: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/slurmguide/slurmrunningjobs.html#examples-using-srun

I attempted to use GaussView on RC but the program never loads and I get a VNC error every time. I also attempted on Sunday night, a couple of days after the rest of CHEM5641 had been added.

Caplins :
Hi Deepak, 

It looks like jobs are running normally on that node now. Did you see anything informative in your slurm output? Error messages or other indication of what went wrong?

May have been an intermittent issue with the node note responding to slurm quickly enough. 

Cheers, 
Serena



----------------------------------------
Description : Dear all,
I'm facing this problem for the second time when running the same job:

Slurm Job_id=37943040 Name=LongPartition_CellLine_gencode_nanopolish.sh Failed, Run time 1-07:32:46, NODE_FAIL, ExitCode 0

Can you please help me understand why it's happening? Is it because of some wrong settings I'm using? I already ran the same .sh script several times on the long partition and experienced a node failure just once. Anyway, in the previous case, I was able to complete the job by re-launching the script, while this time the node failure happened twice.

Any help it's appreciated as I need to complete this analysis soon, and the job already failed twice after very long execution times.

I'm including my PI in cc so she can be informed about the delay.

Hello Oleksandra,

I am just reaching out to see if you are still facing this error after my initial message or if the jobs have been running successfully.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Oleksandra,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing and my apologies on the delay on responding to your ticket. Has this occurred again with your jobs within the last few days? 

After the maintenance window in June, there was some network gear that developed some problems that had to be tracked down and repaired. It was  causing NODE_FAILURE issues starting around that point in time on certain nodes. 

We also just changed a script setting on the cluster as well that may have been causing some of the more recent NODE_FAILURES on certain nodes depending on how busy the node was at the time it ran.  

That is why I ask if this has occurred again within the last few days because the setting change happened a few days ago and we are working on tracking down the cases and cause of this error.

With your program you use for research, can you checkpoint the job so you can resume the job without losing a large portion of work or that isn't a feature in the program?  It is normally recommended to include checkpoints if possible if something like occurs so you do not lose the entire job. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Description : Dear RC Help Team,

My name is Bernardo Zubillaga. I am a postdoc at NEU, with the Physics Dept.

I have been experiencing speed problems with the Discovery Cluster.

The cluster is unusually slow. I have tried using interactive nodes from the "short" partition and from the “CTBP” partition.
Submitting and running jobs in the “CTBP” partition seems to take a very long time, even if I request exclusive access to nodes.
I’m trying to run a shell script to submit some 70 batch jobs in the CTBP partition, which usually takes a handful of minutes or so, but now it takes forever.

Even very simple operations like copying and deleting text files, and editing text files with nano, listing directories with “ls”, etc. takes an unusually long time, when I run them on interactive nodes.

I would be very appreciative if you could take a look into this and help me, with this issue, as the submission and execution of calculations is tremendously inefficient right now.

Thank you very much in advance!

Best,

Bernardo Zubillaga.

Hi Bernardo, 

We were having some issues with a user performing some processes that slowed everything down. Thank you for letting us know about it's impact on your end. We're coming up with a solution and it should be resolved shortly.

Hi Mia 

Thank you for reaching out to RC. 

No maintenance today. This message happens every now and then with the OOD because it is trying to pull up a cached version of the website that no longer exists. You can clear it by clearing your browser cookies and history. 

You can also try running an incognito browser window. If that fixes it then you will want to clear out your browser cache, cookies, and history.

Hi Paarthvi,

Yes, it still says `srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Requested node configuration is not available`

when I use `srun -p reservation --reservation=zongyu_test --gres=gpu:v100-sxm2:8 --time=24:00:00 -N 1 --pty --export=ALL /bin/bash` from the login node. Please extend the time as no work has been done yet.

Thank you,
Zongyu

Hello Paarthvi,

Just realized that your previous command is only for one hour, and now it’s time out.

When I try to use same command to request it again, it says

srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: Requested node configuration is not available

Could you let me know why this is happening?

Description : Hey,

I am curious what the best practices are for mitigating storage sizes? The biggest culprit for myself is my conda environments. I often work between several different environments at once so have multiple conda environments.

My conda environment has grown to 62 GB.

Are people just reinstalling environments each time they need to use them?

Can I also have statistics on the max allowed storage space? I am confident that earlier this month I deleted like 20GB of space, and have returned this week to see that my storage space is maxed out, but theoretically nothing has changed since I gave myself an additional 20 GBs?

Also in the past, I tried moving my conda directory to my /work directory, however that introduced errors when trying to use any conda environment. Is there a way to do this?

Thanks,

Tim

Thanks,

Tim

Caplins :
Hi Tim, 

Yes conda environments are often an issue with the space quota in /home. The current limit is 75 GBs in /home. 

We recommend a few commands that can help including `conda clean --all` which will remove unused packages and reduce the space that conda environments are taking. We have a few additional recommendations here in our documentations: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/homequota.html

Ideally you would create the conda environment in your /work. You can do this with the '--prefix' command but this can make the name of your environment a little unwieldy as you will have to activate it using the full prefix unless you adjust the name after the environment is created.  https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/conda.html

Another maybe optimal suggestion is to use miniconda. I have miniconda3 installed in my /work and this then creates the base environment in /work and all other environments will also automatically be created in /work. I don't have to set the prefix or deal with long paths when activating the environment. Might be worth a try. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Hello Will,

Thank you for letting me know that Bruno was able to run Gaussian jobs and no worry on the confusion. Thank you for letting me know that everyone has been able to successfully run jobs now.

I am going to resolve this ticket. If you have any other questions please reach out to Research Computing at the following links: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/welcome/gettinghelp.html

Hey Joseph,

he was able to run a Gaussian job yesterday.  Sorry for the confusion :

hello steven-

i just added user "mochi.b", but the other two (2) accounts
looked like they were all set. if this is via OOD, users should
probably choose "restart webserver" from the "developer" menu
to flush OOD's cache.

lmk how it goes.
[greg]

ps. mochi.b should be OK after 1926 EDT today.

Cooke :
Hello Steven,

I will look into this and what is causing this. They are part of your unix group and should have access to your partition.

Thank you,

Joseph

The three new students (larmore.s, cannon.wi, mochi.b) still do not have access to the lopez partition. Can you please take care of the issue this time?

Hello Steven,

Just to check, has Bruno been able to successfully use Discovery and access /work/lopez? 

I just heard from a team member they had a message saying Bruno was having difficulties in access the resources and I just want to make sure there isn't something else that is occurring that is preventing him from using your partition and access /work/lopez.

Hello Steven,

My apologies on that being missed on adding them to your unix group. I have just added them now so by noon today the update will be propagated to all systems on Discovery. Please make sure they sign out of any open Discovery sessions and sign back in because unix groups are assigned at login.

Do you have any other questions or anything else that I can assist with or can I resolve the ticket?

Thank you,

Lopez :
reply from: s.lopez@northeastern.edu

Hi,

They are just joining my research group now. Yes, when I approved their Discovery accounts I specifically asked RC to give them access to the gaussian group, /work/lopez directory, and lopez partition. They have my permission to use all of those and should be given access asap so they can start research.

Thanks,

Hello Steven,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. I just checked and neither Sean or Will are part of the `lopez` unix group so they will not have access to your partition or your /work directory. They are part of the gaussian partition so they should be able to use gaussian on Open OnDemand but if their work flow requires access to a Gaussian configuration from your /work directory then I could see it not working. 

Did they put in a request to be part of your unix group and have access to your resources or were they part of it previously? Just want to make sure if they were part of the group what happened since they are not part of the group now. 

Do you grant permission for me to add them to your unix group?

Thank you,

Joseph

Description : Dear RC help team,

I need to run some R code in parallel and from time to time the program needs to call Python. The program uses four R packages, "igraph", "doParallel", "sRACIPE" and "reticulate" and needs to call some python packages that are not in the basic python ("POT"). I've already created a conda environment on home/c.caranica/pyth_ot containing basic python and the POT package. But I cannot set up R.

Can you have somebody make a directory on my home account and install all of the above packages, so I can run my code? I've been trying to do this since Friday last week, with no success. I opened a ticket last Friday INC11862690 , Serena Caplins worked on it for a while, then she left on vacation. Nobody is answering me when I try to see what's going on with this ticket. I do need this solved asap.

Thank you.

Hi Leticia, 

I just wanted to circle back on this. I spoke with Greg and other team members who also occasionally have issues with conda taking a long time to create an environment. 

Currently our best recommendation is to disable channel priority with this command: conda config --set channel_priority disabled
And commenting out the channels in the .yml file

Alternatively, you could try installers like mamba which is designed to be faster than conda. Mamba is able to create environments in the same way as conda and even pulls them from the same channels (conda-forge etc). 

We suspect that the slowness could be due to network issues. We're in the process of developing a way to check the within discovery network but that will be a little down the road. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Adao Gomes :
reply from: adaogomes.l@northeastern.edu

Hi Serena,
Thank you for your reply!
I think there was a miscommunication during the troubleshooting process. I sent the link to the correct Pyflow through Teams in July.
Regarding the questions:

  1.  I followed the steps on GitHub, but the setup of the Anaconda environment is taking too long. As I mentioned before, I installed Pyflow in the past, and my environment worked without any issues. However, now when new users try to install, the creation of the environment runs for hours and does not finish.
  2.  I tried commenting out the .yml file, but the environment still takes a long time to be created (it stopped after 15 minutes). Here is the .yml file that I used:

name: pyflow

channels:

defaults :

conda-forge :

rdkit :

dependencies:

python=3.8.1 :

openbabel :

rdkit :

pip :

pip: :

tqdm :

gitpython :

tabulate :

Just to let you know, Greg had a meeting to discuss strategies for the Lopez group to manage the Pyflow environment, and someone is currently working on it.

Caplins :
Hi Leticia, 

This makes much more sense and would have been useful to know from the beginning. Have you tried following the steps on that page to create the environment? Or is that what you were doing when it was taking too long? I think we have resolved some of the issues in conda taking too long to create the environment. 

You will need to follow all the steps there to create the environment correctly. The third step installs the correct pyflow from the git hub repo. 

I have never used pyflow before and was surprised that the environment.yml file didn't contain it. 

I just tested it on my end and it created the environment. I did comment out the channels in the .yml file like we had done previously as the channels really slowed it down in my first test (I stopped it after 20 min). With the channels commented out the environment was created in less than 5 min.  

Cheers, 
Serena

Hi Serena,

During our conversation, we think that you may have the wrong pyflow. The environment I am trying to create is from this GitHub page: https://github.com/kuriba/PyFlow

Caplins :
Hi Leticia, 

Okay. This means you didn't already have a .bash_profile. Does just copying the new .bashrc fix the problem with your prompt?

The only way to run pyflow without the ood is to run it on a login node, which we don't recommend as it slows down the system for everyone (including you). 

Cheers, 
Serena

Adao Gomes :
reply from: adaogomes.l@northeastern.edu

Hi Serena,
When I try the following command mv .bash_profile .bash_profile_off.

I’m getting the following error message: mv: cannot stat ‘.bash_profile’: No such file or directory

Also, these changes are to run pyflow without ood, right?

Caplins :
Hi Leticia, 

I think this error comes from the program unable to authenticate you as a user. And I'm guess this is because of your bash prompt. I noticed it was not right when we had a consultation. Let's see if the problem goes away if we fix it. 

Can you please copy new .bashrc and .bash_profile scripts from /etc/skel

You can fist move your current .bachrc and .bash_profile to off to save any changes you've made there. 
Make sure you're in your home directory and run the following:

mv .bashrc .bashrc_off
mv .bash_profile .bash_profile_off

cp /etc/skel/.bashrc .
cp /etc/skel/.bash_profile

Then log out and log back in. 

As for running pyflow outside of the OOD. This is not something we recommend as it puts a strain on the login node. And the compute nodes don't support it.

Let me know if that helps!

Cheers,

Hi Serena,
Sorry for the delay, I am in a conference, and I was unable to access ood.
I did the test on the virtual desktop It didn't work for me. Please see the screenshot below.
Also, I would appreciate it if we could use the new environment without the virtual desktop, since we can use Pyflow to set up, submit, and monitor the progress of a workflow, just like we could with the old Pyflow env that I installed before the long time to create the env.

Hi Leticia, 

It looks like pyflow needs a windowing environment. I am able to get it to work from the OOD desktop app which will allow pyflow to open a window and you can set everything up from there. 

So you will launch a session on the Desktop interactive app and then go to the "Applications" tab in the upper right, select "Terminal Emulator", load the anaconda module, activate your pyflow environment, and then re-run that pyflow set up command. See attached screen shots.

Let me know how that works for you!

Cheers, 
Serena

Hi Leticia, 

Thank you for opening the ticket. Below is a summary of what I have done so far. I believe it will work now, but please let me know if that is the case. I don't have all the inputs necessary to run a true test (but I assume you do). Let me know if that's not the case and the environment is still missing something.

The issue was conda taking a very long time (hours) to create an environment from a .yml file. 
1. We commented out the conda init statement for the .bashrc
2. ran this command to remove channel priority: conda config --set channel_priority disabled
3. We also commented out the channels listed on the .yml file
4. The environment was successfully created from this .yml file:
name: pyflow
channels:
defaults :
conda-forge :
rdkit :
dependencies:
python=3.8.1 :
openbabel :
rdkit :
pip :
pip: :
tqdm :
gitpython :
tabulate :
prefix: /home/$USER/.conda/envs

5. However some packages (pyflow) were missing. Because the .yml file contained a mix of packages from conda and pip I was unable to add pyflow without compilation errors to the existing environment.
6. A new environment was created with all packages being installed with conda which allows conda to resolve package dependencies conflicts as it creates the environment. This worked and the environment was created in less than 20 minutes
This is the new .yml file:
name: pyflow2
channels:
defaults :
conda-forge :
rdkit :
dependencies:
python=3.8.1 :
openbabel :
rdkit :
tqdm :
gitpython :
tabulate :
pyflow :
#prefix: /home/$USER/.conda/envs/pyflow2

7. testing required as I received an error that not all input files were found when I ran the command:  pyflow setup test-workflow --config_file config.json
and when I ran this command: pyflow init

Cheers, 
Serena

Hi Cole,

Thanks for reaching out to Research Computing.

To access Discovery, you must first have an account. You can request an account through ServiceNow but need a Northeastern username and password. If you are new to the university or a visiting researcher, you should work with your sponsor to obtain a Northeastern username and password.

HPC users need a sponsor, usually a professor, to approve their request. Students (undergraduate or graduate), visiting researchers, or staff members must have a sponsor approve their request. When you fill out the ServiceNow form, an email is sent to the specified sponsor upon submitting the request. Sponsors will receive email reminders until they approve the request through the link in the email to ServiceNow. We recommend letting your sponsor know to look for the email with the approval link before submitting an access request.

To request an account, follow these steps:
Visit the ServiceNow RC Access Request form : https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0ae24596db535fc075892f17d496199c

Complete the form, check the acknowledgment box, and submit it.

Your request may take up to 24 hours after your sponsor approves it. You will receive an email confirmation when your access has been granted.

Let me know if you have any additional queries.

Regards,
Girish Pillai

Periaswamy :
Hello Arjun,

Your old account seems to be removed from LDAP. That's the protocol that Northeastern uses to keep track of active students. While your old account was removed from the Northeastern database, your account was still present in discovery. But since open on-demand uses LDAP we are unable to query your old account, Hence we requested you to get a new account. I can now see that ar.singh account is active, hence I believe the issue should be resolved.

I apologize for all the trouble I am causing, I just want to avoid having duplicate accounts which will inevitably lead to clashing of access to prior work and so on.

Hello Arjun,

I have thoroughly investigated the issue you encountered, and it appears that your user account is currently not included in the database queried via the LDAP protocol, which OOD relies on for authentication. As a result, although you can SSH into the cluster, you are unable to access OOD.

Description : Hi,

I'm a PhD student working on linear optimization, and my current research involves a large computational evaluation requiring the use of Gurobi's linear optimization software. However, I'm unsure how to get Gurobi to work on the HPC cluster since Gurobi requires a machine-specific license.


According to Gurobi's site (https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/articles/360013195412-How-do-I-obtain-a-free-academic-license-for-a-cluster-or-a-shared-computer-lab-):

A multi-user Educational Institution Site license is also the recommended license for use on an academic HPC cluster.

This type of license must be managed by a system administrator. To request this license, please ask the system administrator to submit a support request<https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us/requests/new> in our Help Center<https://support.gurobi.com/hc/en-us>.


Is this possible, or will I need to run the computational evaluation on a local machine?

Description : Hi,
I would like to use the "targets" package in R on the OOD discovery cluster. However, it has a dependency of "igraph" which has a dependency of "libglpk40".

Hello Jason,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. What flavor of RStudio are you using from the OOD menu? I just tried to:

install.packages("targets")

inside of the 'Geospatial' flavor of the RStudio of OOD and it was able to install that package. The different flavors have different system and R packages installed natively with Geospatial having the most additional packages. When I run into that error message I normally try it in the Geospatial flavor just because of the additional packages.

Could you try it and see if it works for you and your workflow?

Thank you,

Cooke :
Hello Kunyuan,

Sorry for the delay in the response. I do not have access to a windows machine to test MobaXTerm on to see about the errors you are receiving using SCP. Have you tried other alternatives such as Globus or FileZilla to transfer your data or would you be open to using them to move your data to and from Discovery? 

From a command line, not signed into Discovery, you would run the following:

scp <username>@xfer.discovery.neu.edu:/path/to/file . 

and this will copy the file from the directory on Discovery to the directory you run the command in on the terminal. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Qiao :
RITM Update: reply from: k.qiao@northeastern.edu

Dear Joseph,

  Thank you and I hope the long partition can be approved. Even the long partition is not enough and I might submit another request soon.

  I am trying to move it from my /work/KunyuanQiao on the cluster to your local computer (and I assigned a folder to be my home folder for MobaXTerm). Previously, I used scp k.qiao@xfer....... to transfer data from my local computer to the /scratch folder on cluster and it worked. But now I tried the reverse but could not achieve it.


Best,
Kunyuan

Cooke :
Hello Kunyuan,

No problem. I just left a work note on your long ticket saying that you are applying for long and evaluate it for that and not large. A team member will be picking up the ticket since it is now in our queue. 

Where are you trying to transfer the data to? Are you trying to transfer it on the cluster to the cluster? Like from /work to /scratch or your /home on the cluster? Or are you trying to move it from your /work on the cluster to your local computer? Sorry for asking for more details but I just want to be certain so I know how I can help more.

Thank you,

Joseph

Qiao :
RITM Update: reply from: k.qiao@northeastern.edu

Dear Joseph,

  Thank you and I think I approved it ten days ago via email, immediately after I received the email. But it showed up that it required my approval, and I just did it again. I did not find a way to modify the ticket.

  The approach you suggested still didn't work. The first step I took was to change the direction to be my home directory, from where I transferred data to the scratch folder. Then running the modified command you suggested, exactly the same error message popped up.

  usage: scp [-12346BCpqrv] [-c cipher] [-F ssh_config] [-i identity_file]
           [-l limit] [-o ssh_option] [-P port] [-S program]
           [[user@]host1:]file1 ... [[user@]host2:]file2

  I don't know what to do next. Thanks.

Best,
Kunyuan

Cooke :
Hello Kunyuan,

You are welcome. 

For the long partition request, please check your email and you should have got an email to approve the request. Once you approve it, it will go into our queue and a team member can start to work on it. You can also change the request from large to long because the large partition is meant to span multiple nodes while long is meant to span multiple days in duration.

No problem on the data transfer. Sorry for not understanding what you were explaining. 

You will want to run 

scp k.qiao@xfer.discovery.neu.edu:/work/KunyuanQiao/fuzzyAE2.dta . 

from your local terminal in the directory you want to save your file in. So while not connected to Discovery, change directory on your local machine to where you want to save the file and run the above command and it will copy the file fuzzyAE2.dta to the directory you are currently in.

Thank you,

Joseph

Qiao :
RITM Update: reply from: k.qiao@northeastern.edu

Dear Joseph,

  Thank you for the elaboration.

  X11 is much slower unfortunately and I compared it with the OOD. I hope you could help me check in regarding the request of the long partition.

  I am sorry that I was not clear on data transfer. I am using xfer and scp and they didn't work. For example, at MobaXTerm terminal, I typed in
  cd /work/KunyuanQiao
  scp -r k.qiao@xfer.discovery.neu.edu:/work/KunyuanQiao/fuzzyAE2.dta

  It shows up
  usage: scp [-12346BCpqrv] [-c cipher] [-F ssh_config] [-i identity_file]
           [-l limit] [-o ssh_option] [-P port] [-S program]
           [[user@]host1:]file1 ... [[user@]host2:]file2

  but nothing happened and I did not see my file.

Best,
Kunyuan

Cooke :
Hello Kunyuan,

You are welcome and thank you for letting me know your other questions.

1. Requesting jobs through OOD and through the terminal put in you in same queue if you are using the same partition (ie 'short'). The wait time in the queue is dependent on the number of jobs you have requested (we have a limit of 50 running jobs at a time), the resources currently available, and how busy the cluster currently is running. For the resources you are requesting, 64 cores and 256 GB of memory, that might make the wait longer because the number of nodes that have 64 cores is limited and 256 GB of memory to be available on those nodes with other jobs running. If you reduce the number down to 56 cores, there are more nodes that have that amount than 64 cores so your wait time might reduce but it is dependent also on how busy the cluster is as well.

For X11, it isn't limited as much as it can be slower than the OOD version based on the connection. You should be able to do everything you do in OOD in an X11 connection, it might just have some lag and be a little slower in terms of user experience. The X11 connection would also have the 24 hour limit as well because it is running on the short partition and that is the dependent item in terms of the time limit.

2. I can check with the team member that has your long partition request to see the status of it. You can also message on the ticket as well to get updates from that team member too.

3. You are correct, your data will not be purged in /work space. The only purging that occurs is in /scratch/$USER so your data is fine in /work/KunyuanQiao. To move data from your /work space to your local storage, we can use the xfer node (ssh xfer.discovery.neu.edu) and you can use command tools like scp, or you can setup Globus and use Globus or you can use a program like FileZilla to move your data. We have options listed in our documentation (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html and https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/globus.html) so please let me know which one sounds the best to you and if you have any questions with getting it setup.

Thank you,

Joseph

Qiao :
RITM Update: reply from: k.qiao@northeastern.edu

Dear Joseph,

  Thank you and yes, I still have some questions.

  1.  Currently I have requested two short partitions but one day has elapsed, and I have not been approved by this allocation. Thus, I used X11 with the MobaXTerm terminal. Is it also the same as I request online from OOD, like 64-core CPU and 256GB memory? It seems that per your prior emails, X11 is limited? Does it have a 24-hour limit as well?
could you please let me know when I could secure it? :
  3.  Finally, now my data are in the working directory work/KunyuanQiao so that it will not be purged in 28 days. However, I do not know how to export them back to my local storage. I used scp and other commands but they don't work.

  Thank you!

Best,
Kunyuan

Cooke :
Hello Kunyuan,

Thank you for answering my questions and sorry about the delay in the response. X11 forwarding can be very slow compared to something like OOD because of the connection type. OOD uses VNC connections so it can provide a smoother experience in using graphical applications. 

Thank you for letting me know that you are breaking up your simulations into different parts so you can run them on short. I suggested to see if there was a speed difference because some programs can only utilize a certain amount of cores up to a point and then you don't notices any improvements on speed of calculations. 

Do you have any other questions so can I resolve this ticket?

Thank you,

Joseph

Qiao :
RITM Update: reply from: k.qiao@northeastern.edu

Dear Joseph,

  Thank you and I am using X11 forwarding rather than the command line. Now I figured out the problem – it looks like there is a type in my command and so the code did not run last time. However, X11 forwarding still seems pretty slow while OOD through website is much faster.

  I have not noticed the speed change but now I am trying to break my data up so that I can work on these different parts. I currently plan to open many “short” partitions with an interactive mode and run these simultaneously.

  However, a “long” partition is still very helpful for me in case I miss something.

Best,
Kunyuan

Cooke :
Hello Kunyuan,

For your MobaXTerm sessions, are you using X11 forwarding to use the graphical interface of STATA or are you using a command line version of STATA?

When you say interactive mode do you mean through OOD or through X11 forwarding in MobaXTerm? My apologies on not being incredibly familiar with STATA and how it functions but that is something we can definitely look into.

That is good to hear that you submitted the request for long. You can also use 128 cores on the short partition as well. Have you noticed the rate of processing increase with the increased number of cores in test?

Thank you,

Joseph

Qiao :
RITM Update: reply from: k.qiao@northeastern.edu

Dear Joseph,

  Thank you so much for your reply!

  The MobaXTerm's interactive mode just does not respond to my request or it closes automatically when I load very large datasets. On the contrary, OOD can load the data (360G+) within ~20 minutes.

  I was using very simple command called matchit, which is a fuzzy matching method in Stata. When I type in the variable name in the command window, Stata in OOD says such variable does not exist. However, if I click on that variable so that the variable name pops up as text in the command window, then it works. That is why I think using an interactive mode is better and I can debug throughout the process.

64 core :


Best,
Kunyuan

Cooke :
Hello Kunyuan,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. When you say MobaXTerm doesn't seem to have a large enough space, all directories that you have access to through Open OnDemand you have access to through MobaXTerm. When you say loading data in MobaXTerm is slower, could you give an example of a time it is slower than through Open OnDemand? 

Could you share what commands you are trying to run in STATA that doesn't allow you to see a variable but it gives you an error message? Just looking to possibly debug why this is occurring for you also.

Do you have an estimate on how much longer the job would take than 24 hours? Have you experimented with how your code runs on more cores (does it scale with more cores or does your core primarily run in single threaded runs)? How many cores are you requesting in your jobs and how much memory are you requesting as well? There is a partition that we have that allows for longer than 24 hours of run time (long) and that is completed through a submission process. We check your work flow to see if your job can be checked pointed to run on multiple short jobs and fit within the 24 hour time period and if there is any suggestions we can give in terms of speeding up your job. 

Thank you,

Joseph

RITM Update: reply from: k.qiao@northeastern.edu

Dear Greg,

  Thank you so much for the elaboration and I look forward to save some data to the folder /work/KunyuanQiao!

  I am currently using OOD for the main computation (because the MobaXTerm does not seem to have a large space and/or is much slower in loading the data).

  I seem to have to use the interactive mode because the software (STATA) returns strange error messages when I type in things rather than clicking on them (e.g., for one variable, even if I type in exact the same name, STATA reports an error message; the error does not occur if I click on the variable name to get it).

  Almost 24 hours have passed since I ran the last module, and the computation is not finished. So, I am wondering whether there are some ways to request a longer duration than "short" and a larger OOD limit so that the job could be done with the allocated resource.

Best,
Kunyuan

Shomo :
hello && happy monday ! 

the OOD limits are arbitrary and we can change those to fit your
requirements. while there are a couple of machines with 1TB+ of
memory, the bulk of the cluster tops out at ~512GB.

formally, all slurm jobs do have a partition. if you do not specify one
explicitly, slurm will assign the default partition (ie, 'short') to your job.
short has a time-limit of 24h, so that may (not) be appropriate for your
work.

you can run stata interactively also. please do let us know if some part
of our documentation suggests that one must use the batch-syntax (as
opposed to interactive). while i would suggest that the batch syntax is
strongly preferred, it is not required. you need to be awake to do work
interactively, whereas batch jobs can do work while-you-sleep (which 
is a small sort of magick).

i hope that helps
&& i'll get to work on your space at /work/KunyuanQiao presently.

Qiao :
RITM Update: reply from: k.qiao@northeastern.edu

Dear Greg,

  Thank you and sure!

  And I actually have a series of questions after reading the long document<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/welcome/welcome.html> for HPC and watching the LinkedIn video:

  1.  I want to use Stata/17-mp to process a gigantic dataset (360G), and I am transferring it to /scratch folder. It is still an ongoing process. However, even if I have successfully transferred the data there, will I be able to process it with Stata? It looks like Stata only allocates 256G for me based on OOD and so I am worried about it.
  2.  Then to use slurm, do I have to specify partition? It seems that I have to set up a time duration and memory. I am not sure how long the job will take.
  3.  Finally, my understanding is that I need to write up the Stata syntax and then type "srun stata name_of_my_code.do" to perform the task?

  Thank you!

Best,
Kunyuan

Shomo :
hello kunyuan-

thank you for reaching out to RC !

given that we use unix systems, the 'space' character
is probably best avoided in directory names. would you

Hi William,

Thanks for reaching out to RC regarding this. Glad to know that it finally worked out for you. 

Sometimes, if Gaussian through OOD ends up on a faulty node this could happen. Do you remember the host names for your sessions, the one that worked and the one that didn't? 

Typically, changing the time shouldn't have any effect. So I will still be interested in knowing if you ended up on a different node when Gaussview worked for you. I'll keep the ticket open for another day, if in case, you can provide some more information regarding this.

Description : Hello,

I'm doing computational research for my PhD thesis in the Chakraborty lab and am having issues running my code on the cluster. I need to run a python script that calls the following packages and used vmd/1.9.3.

  *   pandas
  *   Bio.PDB (from biopython library)
  *   os
  *   pymol

I have tried running the code on every python version available on the cluster and none of them seem to support all packages. I've mainly had issues with pymol, Bio.PDB, and pandas where I get import errors saying there is no package with those names. Additionally, python 3.8.1 gave an error saying that code in pandas was deprecated. Locally, I've been able to run the code on python/3.10.6 but it's too resource intensive to get through all my data on the local machine.

To my knowledge, users don't have permission to pip install these packages. Please let me know if there is currently a way for me to run this script on discovery. If not, would it be possible to add updated python versions or these packages to discovery?

Hi Prajwal,

I apologize for my late response. I was able to set up a conda environment on discovery, but I am still running into issues loading all my packages. I think the main problem is with Bio which is from biopython. I am able to conda install biopython, but then it says there is no module named Bio. I've found this issue online (linked below) and it sounds like the directory the package is installed in is often incorrectly named with a lowercase 'b' (bio instead of Bio), but I haven't been able to find that folder and am not sure if I would have permissions to modify it regardless. This issue is no longer time-sensitive, but my lab will need to use biopython tools on discovery, so any advice you have on getting it to work would be greatly appreciated.

the fact that the vscode version on discovery is more than 2 years out of date is causing a lot of problems for us, specifically there are features in newer versions of the vscode python extension that are necessary for us to use things like the debugger.

Thanks! so far it seems to be working good. I am not sure if this is a fixable problem, so don't waste too much of your time looking at it, but to install github copilot I had to download a vsix file and install it that way. It does not show up in the extensions store. I haven't noticed it for other extensions, but it seemed odd. I did not need to do anything in my local vscode setup to get it to show up, but they have made some features premium since I first installed it so maybe that changed some things.

Cooke :
Hello Chris,

You are welcome and I will keep this ticket open for a bit to see if you or your lab mates encounter any problems or have feedback.

Thank you,

Joseph

Blais :
Thank you all so much. I will pass this on the the rest of the lab and we'll test it and give you feedback.

Cooke :
Hello Chris,

I just wanted to let you know that we just pushed VSCode 1.80.2 to OOD. Please try it out and see how it works. You have to enter a password on the OOD form (it can be anything) and you will have to re enter that password when the job launches and you open the session VSCode. 

Please let me know if you encounter any problems.

Thank you,

Joseph

Blais :
That's awesome! Thank you so much!

Cooke :
Hello Chris,

Thank you for your patiences. The latest version of VSCode (1.80.2) is currently being tested for OOD and I will update you when I have more information.

Thank you,

Joseph

Blais :
Great, thank you!

Cooke :
Hello Chris,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. We are looking into updating VSCode on OOD and getting that tested. We will update with progress as we proceed. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Blais :
No worries, us at the west lab appreciate it, thanks!

Shomo :
the ood way is the best way, tbh, for services like this. 
let me see who in the group has time to update vscode.

i am not at my computer tomorrow and have 7h of 
meetings on thursday. it may be friday before i reply
again.

[greg]

Blais :
Hey Greg, 
Yes, the current version is from April 2021 I believe. If there's a work around that allows us to run a more up to date instance that's not on OOD we could work with that too I know you all are swamped. The other HPC system I work on has a way to launch a remote vscode session on a compute node. If that's possible on discovery as well we could try that, I just could use a hand setting it up. 
Thanks,
Chris B

Description : Hello!
I'm Kavya, a graduate student at Northeastern University specializing in Machine Learning and Deep Learning. Recently, I came across your RA position on workday, and I wanted to express my enthusiasm for the HPC-related role that focuses on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL). Talking to Paarthvi, who also works with you, I realized that this position aligns perfectly with my interests, as I regularly deal with GPUs in my deep learning models. Having a Master's degree in Machine Learning and expertise in ML/DL frameworks, I am well-prepared to contribute to your HPC projects. I have a strong background in parallel computing, GPU utilization, and large-scale cluster deployment, which are precisely what this role requires. I am eager to utilize my ML and DL skills to support researchers and drive innovative solutions.

Thank you for considering my application. I have attached my resume for your review. I am looking forward to discussing how my proficiency in ML and DL can benefit your organization's HPC initiatives.

Subject: MRtrix help
Hi Joseph,

Hope all is well. I am reaching out to you specifically because we have worked together in the past on MRtrix on the cluster and you have some experience. If this is not allowed, let me know and I will create a new ticket.

My current issue is using this command<https://mrtrix.readthedocs.io/en/dev/reference/commands/5ttgen.html> “singularity exec --nv ${mx} 5ttgen -nocrop hsvs ${FS_DIR} ${PP_DIR}/5tt_hsvs.nii.gz” I think the issue lies with the use of fsl in this command. It seems to not be able to run the command “run_first_all -s L_Accu,R_Accu,L_Amyg,R_Amyg,L_Caud,R_Caud,L_Hipp,R_Hipp,L_Pall,R_Pall,L_Puta,R_Puta,L_Thal,R_Thal -i T1.nii -b -o first”.

I attached the slurm and script file for you. If you would like to test it out yourself, I copied over the necessary files into my /scratch/tinney.e/mrtrix_test.

Let me know if you can help! Thank you.

Best,
Emma

With using this container it already as FSL in it so we don't have to module load that or source the license path. I am not sure how it would change the rest of your script but this might be worth trying because it seems to work well.

That is correct. The 5ttgen file should be created from the 5ttgen command. It isn’t there yet because the command is failing.

Hello Emma,

Just a follow up question. Would FS_DIR be 10004_MR1_FS_HIRES and PP_DIR be 10004_MR1? I ask because I don't see a 5tt_hsvs.nii.gz inside of the 10004_MR1 directory. I see other *.nii.gz files in that directory. Not sure if there is one of those I should run the command on.

Thank you,

That does answer my question! Thank you. I was reading the script and noticing that the directory you shared didn't match the form of some of the early scripting and I didn't know where that data started and stopped. 

Thank you for clarifying that.

Joseph

Tinney :
reply from: tinney.e@northeastern.edu

Yes, the 5ttgen line of code is the code that is currently crashing. And everything in that folder is from the code prior to that line. In that folder should be the data to run just that 5ttgen command without running the whole script. Does that answer your question?

Hello Emma,

I am going through the script and the error message. Your input script looks like it is reference additional files and directories from /work. Specifically the PP_DIR variable. The path that is set in that variable doesn't appear like the directory of the data you stored in your /scratch directory for me try this with. Do you have the data up to the point where the program crashes because it is having issues accessing FSL? That way I could just try and run the statement that seems to be causing the issue inside the container and try and debug the error it is generating.

Hello Emma,

My apologies for taking so long to get back to you. I looked over the log file and also the input script and noticed that you were using the mx=/shared/container_repository/MRtrix/MRtrix3.sif container. Did you try the mrtrix_ubuntu.sif container in the same path? I know that container has a full version of FSL installed in it since it seems to be an issue of it utilizing FSL. 

I will start trying to run the container but just wanted to know if you had tried that container or if you were using the previous container because of a feature.

Thank you,

Joseph

Hi Jones,

The "Gaussian" field in the form corresponds to a Unix group associated with the GaussView software. If you believe that you will need access to this software for your work, you should respond accordingly. If not, you can simply answer "No". 

I hope this clarifies your query.

Best Regards,
Prasanth

Hi Prasanth,

Thank you for the pointer. I was able to fill out the form, but one question confuses me, i.e., “Gaussian”. What should I answer? No?!

Thanks.

Best,
Jones

Subject: Problem with using VSCode

Hi,

One student in our lab (vig group) has some problems with VSCode launching. His name is Jiaben Chen, and his account is jiabe.chen@northeastern.edu<mailto:jiabe.chen@northeastern.edu>.

Specifically, when he tries to launch VSCode in OnDemand, there is an error showing at OnDemand:
[cid:55bd47b4-24d2-463c-a92c-fefd0ca85957]


And he checks that he only has about 500kb storage used at /home/jiabe.chen directory. Also, he can’t access the login.discovery.neu.edu<http://login.discovery.neu.edu/> using the VSCode at local via ssh. But previously he can use both the above ways to get access to the server to use VSCode.

Could you help to check the issue and fix it? Thanks a lot! Your timely reply would be more than appreciated.

Best,
Guangyuan

Cooke :
Hello Guangyuan,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. I just checked Jiaben's $HOME directory and it looks like they have 99 GB of space taken there and the quota is set at 75 GB. for everyone. They can check their $HOME storage usage with the following command:

du -shc .[^.]* *

ran in the $HOME directory. When I did it, it shows:

20K     .bash_history
512     .bash_logout
512     .bash_profile
1.0K    .bashrc
24G     .cache

80K     .dotnet
512     .emacs
512     .gsutil
62K     .ipynb_checkpoints
429K    .ipython
1.5K    .jupyter
512     .keras
512     .kshrc

98M     .torch
435M    .vscode-server
1.0K    .wget-hsts
808K    ondemand
99G     total

The bulk of the space taken seems to be in .cache which can be safely removed if nothing is running and in .conda. We have in our documentation some recommendations on how to clean up conda spaces and you can prefix the conda environments to a /work directory if they are research related as well. 

https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/conda.html#using-conda
https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/homequota.html

The error message is because OOD wants to write log files when it launches the applications and it can't because of being over quota. If Jiaben can remove or move some of the files and try opening the application again and we can further assist if there is other issues.

Thank you,

Joseph

Description : Hi,

I'll be teaching CHEM5641 Computational Chemistry this Fall again, and I'd like to have a training session for students not familiar with using computing clusters. The first lecture will be Sept. 12 6-8:30 pm. I'm thinking to have the training at 7:30-8:30 pm. Do you think this is possible? It will be useful to cover the basics such as logging in, basic shell commands, using slurm, the setup of the Discovery queuing system, using OOD, using chemistry-related software, and other things one should be aware of using Discovery.

Also, we'd like to continue using /work/courses/CHEM5641. I have sent in a classroom use request. Could you give the students access to this folder?

Thanks!
Sijia

Dong :
reply from: s.dong@northeastern.edu

Hi Serena,

Thank you. This would be fantastic! Yes, teaching the students how to access them will be good enough. Will you provide the training in-person or virtually?

I hope that the students can be given access to Discovery by early next week.

Thanks!
Sijia

Caplins :
Hi Sijia, 

Thank you for reaching out to RC. We'd be happy to provide the training that you are requesting for your class. I am available to carry out the training. As far as including Chemistry related software, I have a background in Bioinformatics so my ability to cover the programs that you may be using in your course throughly is limited. What I can do is show students how to access each program on discovery but won't go into how to use them necessarily (and I imagine that's what you will be covering in the course!). 

I have this list of programs from your classroom use request: Schrodinger, Gromacs, VMD, Mathematica, MATLAB, Tensorflow, PyTorch

If there are any other programs that you're interested in having a brief introduction on let me know. 

And yes we'll have you set up in /work/courses which has moved to just /courses. We are also automating our process of adding students to the course folder so students will be added directly from canvas. We'll be sending out more information on this to all instructors very soon. 

Cheers, 
Serena

3. After they have completed the steps above, log into ServiceNow using the sponsored account credentials, and submit the following to request the Discovery account:
https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0ae24596db535fc075892f17d496199c

Once you have an active discovery account, I can request the access to my new storage space. Please let me know if you have any question.

Best,
Sunny

Dear Prof.Yang,

I want to express my gratitude for your understanding and supportive message regarding my new job opportunity. It means a lot to me to have your encouragement to continue working on this project.

As for the new storage space on the Discovery server, I would be happy to upload all the relevant files and codes from my GitHub account once you have secured access. Additionally, I would like to try a computing resource that may be available to us. If this option proves to be successful, I am willing to continually contribute to the project to the best of my abilities.

Thank you again for your support.

Hello Manyuan,

I hope this message finds you well. First and foremost, please allow me to extend my sincere congratulations on your recent acceptance of a full-time job offer. Based on the high-quality work you have produced during our time together, I have no doubt that you will excel in your future endeavors.

In light of your new career opportunities, I fully understand if you have limited time to devote to our project. If this is the case, I would kindly request that you complete your current work on the project before passing it on to my future RA. I have recently requested new storage space for our OCR project to the Discovery server. I will notify you once I have secured access to the new storage, and would appreciate it if you could upload all pertinent files and codes from your GitHub onto the Discovery server.

In the meantime, please do not hesitate to contact me if you require any assistance or additional resources.

Thank you for your dedication and effort thus far; it has been invaluable to my project.

Best regards,
Sunny

Shomo :
hello sunny-

thank you for reaching out to RC !

i've just added  man.lu to the unix group 'ocrproject'.,
which information takes about 2h to propagate throughout
the cluster. 

after 0822 EDT this morning, please have manyuan logout
of any open ssh-sessions and log back in to the cluster. 

as OOD performs a different sort of caching, manyuan will
have to choose "restart webserver" from the "developer"
menu in the top, black menubar in the OOD site. 

please let us know if you have any questions
&& happy computing !

Hello Emma,


Running the command “fslstats freesurfer//0003107/mri/rh_choroid_susan_segmentation.nii.gz -V”  with the">>" operator followed by the file name should append the output of the command to the file name.


$ fslstats freesurfer//0003107/mri/rh_choroid_susan_segmentation.nii.gz -V” >> output.txt


The key here is to use the append operator ">>" and not the write operator ">". I am not sure what the command "fslstats" outputs, Do you want to append the entire output or do you want to filter it, with some keyword?


Thank you,
Surya

Tinney :
reply from: tinney.e@northeastern.edu

Thanks! That worked. I had transferred the script into a newer version of python so it must not have worked with the version in the environment.

Do you think you could address the 2nd question I had? Outputting those values into one single text file from multiple subjects?

Hi,

Unfortunately, I followed the steps and am still getting those same errors. I attached screenshots. Let me know if you can pinpoint what the discrepancies are.
 “File "run_gmm_chp_segmentation.py", line 35
    nib.save(imgObj, f'{subjects_dir}/{subj}/mri/{out_name}')”


Another thing I wanted to bring up, but we ran out of time, was how to save those numerical values (1055 1054.99963) from the command
“fslstats freesurfer//0003107/mri/rh_choroid_susan_segmentation.nii.gz -V” into a text file. I will be doing this on multiple, so I was hoping to add ID and the value into one single txt file to do further analysis on.

Does that make sense? Could you help write a script for this?

Thanks!

Hello Emma,

Thank you for booking a consultation with me yesterday, here's a brief summary of our discussion:

https://github.com/EhsanTadayon/choroid-plexus-segmentation :
When we tried to debug the issue we noticed that nibabel module was missing from your conda environment and that was causing the initial round of issues.
I tried to run the script from my end by copying over the free surfer data.

During the consultation, we went through the procedure to set up a conda environment and install the necessary packages.
Unfortunately, we ran out of time before the installation could complete.


After the consultation, I once again went through the script and it turns out that the script was written in Python 2.7. I was able to build a conda environment with the necessary packages to run the script. I have attached a copy of the environment.yml file which can be used to setup the environment on your side. Here is the procedure the setup the conda environment and run the script:

$module load anaconda3 :
$conda env create -f environment.yml :
$ source activate surf :
load fsl and freesurfer 
$ module load fsl
$ module load freesurfer
$ python2 run_gmm_chp_segmentation.py freesurfer/ <subid> :

I have also attached the output which I received when I ran the run_gmm_chp_segmentation.py script on the free surfer data which you provided. If you go through the file you can notice a couple of errors at the end of the file, I just wanted to confirm if the data you provided is in line with the script.

Hello Augustin,

Thank you for scheduling a consultation today with me and Joseph Cooke. I would like to provide you with a brief summary of our discussion.

https://bit.ly/NURC-PartitionAccess. This will enable us to add you to the Lopez partition. :

Regarding the other issue you raised, where you had to source your .bashrc file every time you submitted a job, we determined that the problem stemmed from a missing module load in the sbatch file. To address this, we suggest adding the line "module load gaussian/g16" before your export statements in the file. This adjustment should resolve the issue, as discussed during the consultation.

I hope this was helpful.

Caplins :
Hi Ryan, 

Actually it appears to be a permissions issue. The directory techs_07 doesn't have write permissions for the group. This can be fixed by the creator of the directory (tinney.e) and there is another ticket currently open to resolve this issue. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Caplins :
Hi Ryan, 

Are you trying to upload multiple pdfs at once? There are a few things that might be happening to make the upload fail. Including not having enough space in the destination directory.  I just checked and it looks like your work directory /cnelab still has ~1TB of space left. So that's not the issue. 

It may just be that you are transferring too many or too large a file for the ood app. You could try zipping or taring the files to compress them prior to upload.

Alternatively you can take a look at our documentation on file transfer. There are many ways to transfer files to and from discovery. We have other ways that support larger or many files https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html

Hope that helps! Let me know if you still need assistance. 

Cheers,

How are you uploading? SCP, globus etc? If you can share more about how you're uploading including any scripts your running I can help troubleshoot what's going wrong.

Description : Hi,

I want to use plink2 & vcftools for file conversions and basic summary stats in bash on the discovery server, but have been having trouble getting these software programs into a local path where I can use them. I know that they’re available on discovery (I found them using module avail), so I don’t think they need to be installed. I think Serena might be able to help! 

Best,
Camille Rumberger

Caplins :
Hi Camille, 

I hope all has been going well with plink2 and vcftools. I double checked and a new version of vcftools hasn't been released since 2015 so we appear to be up to date on that front as well. 

I am going to close this ticket, but please reach out if you need anything else!

Cheers, 
Serena

Caplins :
Hi Camille, 

One quick update. There is a plink2 module that works just fine but needs to be loaded with the right version number. 

module load plink2/2023-04-19

and then when you call it you need to have the command be plink2-x86_64

Otherwise it works as it should. I'll be working on a new vcftools version today. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Rumberger :
Hi Serena!

I'm working in the command line, so I'll try loading the modules, thank you. I wonder what's up with plink2, that would be fantastic if you could figure out what's wrong. Thanks for looking into this.

Camille

Caplins :
Hi Camille!

Yes we have both plink2 and vcftools available as modules. I will note that the vcftools is an old version. Are you trying to use them in Rstudio or the command line?

For the command line you will need to load a compiler with vcftools as:

module load vcftools
module load gcc/5.5.0

And for plink2. I just tried to load the module and it gave me the message "insert best practices here". I am not sure why it's doing that. but I can get it fixed for you. Plinkv1.07 does work fine as a module, but it is old. You can use it with: module load plink

I will let you know when we have an updated vcftools and plink2 working. I have been meaning to get them up and now have a good reason to do so. :)

Cheers, 
Serena

Description : Hi,

While I'm using the VASP modules pre-compiled by our group members, I encountered the error message "error while loading shared libraries: libhdf5_fortran.so.200: cannot open shared object file: No such file or directory".

Greg,

Thanks for letting me know. I was unable to add comments in the portal. I was able to access SFTP yesterday at 6 PM, but now I am unable to. This is highly disruptive, as our lab is currently fully computational due to our recent move to EXP. I have grant update for the National Science Foundation due and it is critical I can access my files. Please let me know.

Thanks,
Michael

Shomo :
hello michael-

thank you for reaching out to RC !

Description : Hi ITS help desk,

Could you please allow access to my DISCOVERY account for the following people:

Dave Kaeli: d.kaeli@northeastern.edu<mailto:d.kaeli@northeastern.edu>
Sana Taghipour Anvari:  taghipouranvari.s@northeastern.edu<mailto:taghipouranvari.s@northeastern.edu>

Thank you

Phaltankar :
Hello Yang,

Since the users have access now, I will go ahead and close this incident.
Please let us know in case of any issues.

Thanks,
Vrushali

Phaltankar :
Hello Yang,

Thankyou for confirming the details. We have added the users mentioned to iSUPER group as below.
$ getent group iSUPER
iSUPER:x:1825891052:d.kaeli,taghipouranvari.s

Please have them logout of discovery and log back in to access the group.

Thanks,

reply from: ya.zhang@northeastern.edu

Hi Vrushali and Greg,

Thank Greg for a great suggestion!
Yes, this is for iSUPER. It makes sense to create /work/iSUPER.

Later, you will receive DISCOVERY account request from new research staff for iSUPER,
including Nicolas Minutillo, and Drs. Thibaud Sarica and Khanh Do.  Please add them to iSUPER.

Note that they all need to access my group's directory, in addition to iSUPER's directory.
Likewise, Sana and Dave may need to access my current student's working directory under my group's working directory.

Several of my current group members are doing iSUPER related work, can they access files under /work/iSUPER?

Best
Yang

Phaltankar :
Hello Yang,

Following up on below comment. Could you please let us know about Greg's query and then we can work on your request?

Thanks,
Vrushali

Phaltankar :
Hello Yang,

Shomo :
@Phaltankar, Vrushali this may not be for "normal lab work". let's see how she answers before typing.

Shomo :
hello yang-

thank you for reaching out to RC ! 

is this for iSUPER or for your regular group's work ? 
if it is for iSUPER, may i suggest a new directory at /work/iSUPER
(and not conflating that with your group's regular bits). 

lmk && i'll set that up.

Hi Joseph

Thanks for the explanation
We are currently waiting for our server in the cluster to set up. We have been working with Greg Shomo on this.
Hopefully it is up and running soon
Thanks

Hello Bryson,

Sorry for the late response. There isn't an application process to get private partitions as much as the private partitions are privately owned hardware that groups (PIs) own.  If you are working with a PI that owns hardware, with the permission of the PI, we can add you to the unix group that would allow you to run on that hardware. 

If you can wait a couple of weeks until the semester is underway, we are looking into allocations which is purchased time on the cluster that you can utilize. That way you can purchase the amount of time you need for your jobs/project. Let me know if that is something you are interested in and we can reach back out.

Thank you,

Joseph

Hi Joseph,

Thanks for the email.
I can checkpoint my jobs, but can I ask is there an application process to get private partitions for unlimited walltime?

Hello Bryson,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing and apologies on the delayed response to your inquiry. 

For the public partitions that we have on Discovery that have GPUs , the gpu partition and multigpu partition, have the wall limits listed on our documentation page (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/hardware/partitions.html). 

What software are you using for your molecular dynamics simulations because we normally suggest checkpointing as a means of running long run time simulations. This is something that we can assist with in helping you get setup.

Thank you,

Joseph

Description : Dear Han, 

Thank you for booking a software installation consultation with me. Below you will find a summary of our meeting. 
1. You inquired how to make a use a custom conda environment with the jupyter lab notebook on the OOD app. 
2. I shared with you our documentation on making and using conda environments on Discovery. https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/conda.html 
3. We walked through loading the anaconda3 module and looking at the environments that you have already made. You had two in your home directory. We suggest making them in the future in your /work directory if you have one. Otherwise be aware that space is more limited in /home and conda environments can take a lot of storage space. (see here: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/homequota.html)
4. Once you have a conda environment made you can launch jupyterlab notebook from that environment by specifiying the name of the environment in the and clicking this option when you launch the jupyterlab notebook from the OOD app: Custom Anaconda Environment (provide name only)

Feel free to reach out if you have any questions or need further assistance!

Cheers, 
Serena

Description : Hi,

My username in the discovery cluster is “li.baol”.

I have lost write access to my files in the discovery cluster. I cannot modify files under my “~/” directory, which is “home/li.baol”. And when I force save the file, the file gets deleted by the system and I can no longer access it.

Could you help me take a look at this issue? Also the system has deleted my ~/.bashrc file through this bug. Could you help me restore my ~/.bashrc file?

I also cannot ssh into discovery through VSCode anymore, even though I’m on VPN. This is also an urgent issue that needs to be resolved.

Thanks,
Baolin

Hello Baolin,

You are welcome and apologies on not changing the ownership of the file to you. I just did that so you can chmod it and edit the file. Please let me know if everything is working.

Thank you,

Joseph

Li :
reply from: li.baol@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

Thank you. Could you give me permission to use the .bashrc file you copied for me? I tried “chmod 755 ~/.bashrc” but I don’t have permission to run the chmod command on this file.

Regards,
Baolin

Cooke :
Hello Baolin,

Thank you for cleaning up some files in your $HOME. I copied a copy of your .bashrc from a snapshot of your $HOME from yesterday. 

The quota on $HOME hasn't changed recently so you may have been over quota and the system wouldn't allow you to open or save things in your $HOME. 

All the home directories have been migrated to the VAST storage system a little bit back so that is one change that happened. 

If you just want to see the storage used in your $HOME, in your $HOME directory you can run

du -sh

and that will provide the total output. I normally run the command I shared earlier because it shows all directories and the space they take which helps to know which ones needs to be addressed first.

Do you have any other questions and is everything working as expected?

Thank you,

Joseph

Li :
reply from: li.baol@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

I have removed some files, could you please provide the .bashrc?

Also, do you know why this issue happens? I have not used discovery for some time and everything was fine before. And when I do “df -h” it no longer shows how much storage I’m using under my $HOME. Something must have changed in discovery.

Thanks,
Baolin

Cooke :

du -shc .[^.]* *

Description : Hi,

I was just transferring some files to my local computer from Discovery. I took a break to do something else, and when I came back about 10min later I no longer had SSH access to xfer, and I've now been refused access (I think because I tried to log in too many times unsuccessfully)


ssh: connect to host xfer.discovery.neu.edu port 22: Connection refused

scp: Connection closed

I still have normal SSH access to the login node on Discovery, so I'm not sure what happened.

This is the command I was using to transfer files:

scp campbell.r@xfer.discovery.neu.edu:/work/props/Rob/path-to-file .

And the file I was trying to copy (a plot I successfully copied over earlier today, but regenerated so was trying to copy again)

-rw-r--r-- 1 campbell.r sjamali 473K Jul 24 18:02 voronoi_oneframe_monocompare-allpops.png

I can use Globus or set up Filezilla as an alternative for now, but I just wanted to make sure everything is okay with my account.

Thank you!

Rob

Shomo :

Shomo :
hello rob-

thank you for reaching out to RC ! 

if you fail authentication "too many times", then
your ipaddress is locked out of that one server for
10 or 15m (i honestly don't remember, but can look
it up if necessary). after that window expires, you 
should be able to login again. 

can you confirm you can ssh to xfer.discovery.neu.edu
again this morning ? 

thank you !

Description : Hi,

Until recently, I was able to check my quota by running "df -h ~", which showed me how many GBs I was using out of my 75GB. Since the latest maintenance, that command doesn't work. Moreover, it seems that the 75GB quota was not enforced properly as I had 125GB in my home folder for the past few weeks and this morning I got the error where you're unable to write any more files, resulting in lost compute jobs.

My question is, what is the quota right now? I still have some 80 GB in use without errors but I'm trying to get back under 75GB. Nonetheless, it would be very helpful if you could clarify how to check this number reliably and what the current quota per user is.

Thank you for your help.

Kindly,

Alberto

Shomo :
hello alberto-

thank you for reaching out to RC !

while there is some magick in our main fileservers,
it is best to check disk usage with 'du -sh ~' and not
the 'df' command. officially, 'df' reports entire filesystem
statistics, while 'du' reports a specific directory.

quotas remain at 75G and 'du -sh ~' is the one-true-way
to determine your current usage.

with that having been said, your home directory is not
a good place for your research. /scratch is much better (but
purged of files > 28 days olde) and /work is the canonical
location for research data.

does your PI already have space allocated at /work ? 
if not, please let me know and we can help to get that
sorted. 

apologies for the inconvenience,
but i hope this helps.

happy computing !

Description : Hello,

I'm trying to transfer sequence data from JGI into the directory /work/jennifer.bowen/Johanna/JGI_Georgia/Annotation using Globus but I just got notified that the storage quota has been exceeded.

I still have quite a bit of data to transfer. Am I able to get access to more space?

Thank you!

Shomo :
hello johanna-

i've just increased the quota on /work/jennifer.bowen 
to 35T, which is the limit to space that we offer to PIs
at no charge. additional space is available, but we do 
chargeback that space at cost to researchers. 

i believe that number will be ~$155/TiB/year, but we
have not finalized that yet (it was $146/TiB/year last
year).

i hope that helps 
&& happy computing !

Hi Greg,

Great, thank you! I think I will need 5 more Tb for this project. However, in the near future, I will be generating more sequence data that will require another 5Tb or so of data.

Thank you!

i've just increased your quota an additional 5TiB.
how much more space do you require ?

Shomo :
hello liwen-

thank you for reaching out to RC !

there are only three (3) files in your /scratch/hou.l directory --
and they are all lists of files to be purged. the current purge list
includes exactly one (1) item, which is the oldest list of files to
be purged.

it looks like you no longer have an account on the cluster (probably
due to graduation), which is why you can not login.

i hope that helps
&& good luck out there !

Hi Lee,

Your request for access is currently in queue awaiting approval from the sponsor. The term "Gaussian" refers to a group within Discovery that has been granted permissions to use the "GaussView" software. If you don't intend to use this specific software, there's no requirement for you to be added to this group.

I hope this helps.

Shenoy :
Hello Brady,

Thank you for contacting RC with your query. The researcher can have an account created in Discovery as long as they are collaborating with someone in Northeastern University. More information on how it can be done can be found here: https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0013989&sys_kb_id=a80e8d6397eb695066d1b83e6253af09&spa=1

After this they will have to set up Duo for 2 factor authentication. Once these two steps are done they can request for a discovery account using the normal process.
Do let me know if you have any more questions.

Thank you,

Are you using a conda environment or have you made any recent changes to your conda environment? 

ImportError: cannot import name 'soft_unicode' from 'markupsafe' (/home/diazvargas.d/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/markupsafe/__init__

Description : Hi there,
I'm trying to access the OOD at ood.discovery.neu.edu with my username (khan.zu) and the correct password. It keeps saying "Your username and/or password do not match". I'm able to ssh in just fine. This was working yesterday.

with regards,
Zulqarnain Khan
001736529

Caplins :
Hi Zulqarnain, 

Your account at z.khan is active now. I've added z.khan to the satputegroup unix group. That also takes ~2 hours to take affect throughout the cluster so by ~7:30 PM EST you should be back in that group. 

As for giving z.khan access to khan.zu (your twin). It would probably be easiest for you to use scp to move files from khan.zu to your new home or other location. That command would look something like this (note the use of the xfer node and not the login node):

scp khan.zu@xfer.discovery.neu.edu:/home/khan.zu/file/path/file.txt z.khan@xfer.discovery.neu.edu:/home/z.khan/new/path


Hope that helps get you back to where you were!

Cheers, 
Serena

Khan :
Will try that! 
Regarding /home/khan.zu, yes please if you can copy that over to /home/z.khan

more importantly, can you make sure I get access to /work/abslab/ and /scratch/khan.zu/ from z.khan?

thanks,
Zulqarnain

Caplins :
Hi Zulqarnain, 

Thank you for your response. We have found the problem (and it is not anything on your end). It looks like when your sponsored account was created, your name was removed from ldap (our database for users emails etc). This impacts the ood because that's where it is looking to authenticate your username and email. 

The best path forward seems to be to make you a new discovery account under your sponsored email username:  z.khan

We created the account on Discovery for z.khan at 2:30 PM EST and it takes about 2 hours to go into affect on the cluster. Do you mind trying to log in to the OOD later this evening or tomorrow with the username: z.khan?

This will also create for you a new home directory. If you'd like to transfer over things from /home/khan.zu to /home/z.khan let us know and we can get you set up. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Khan :
Hi Serena,

Sure, I can do a teams call! If that doesn't work out here are the steps that I'm doing:

I'm using Microsoft Windows

Step 1) open incognito mode on Chrome browser
Step 2) go to https://ood.discovery.neu.edu/ 
(this redirects to https://ood.discovery.neu.edu:5554/auth/ldap/login?back=&state=owmled5d5wb7r7vmps2tal4dj)
Step 3) put username khan.zu
Step 4) put password (i quadruple checked, this is correct, and works on ssh)
Step 5) Click login to open ondemand
Step 6) Error "Your username and/or password do not match."

I have tried this with and without VPN, from campus (in Portland, ME) and from at home.

Caplins :
Hi Zulqarnain, 

Do you have a few minutes for a quick teams call? We are still trying to pin down the problem and a quick call where you screen share trying to log in may help. Otherwise we will try and get this resolved today. Sorry about the delay.

Cheers, 
Serena

Khan :
Hi there,

I'd appreciate an update on this. I'm still unable to access OOD and this impacts my work.

I will continue working on this and let you know when to try again. Was it all working fine last week? 

Cheers, 
Serena

Khan :
Hi Serena,

Thank you for your response. I tried logging in again. It's still the same problem unfortunately. (I'm able to ssh in fine, just the OOD doesn't work).

thanks,
Zulqarnain

Caplins :
users home had a bunch of files with group 50754:
His /home/khan.zu was also in unix group 50754

Caplins :
HI Khan, 

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you. Yes your username for discovery is khan.zu

We do not have an account on discovery for z.khan. 

You should just use the username (all lowercase) : khan.zu
And your normal password to log in. 

However, I think I found the problem. There was an issue with your /home directory and the unix group to which it belonged. Can you try logging in again and let me know if you can now access the OOD?

Cheers, 
Serena

Khan :
Hi there,

I'd appreciate an update on this if possible. thanks.

Khan :
I'm wondering if this is related to my student ID moving to alumni status. Please note that I'm now an employee at Northeastern (my employee email is z.khan@northeastern.edu, but if possible I'd like to maintain access to discovery through khan.zu@northeastern.edu as I have data connected to that account on discovery)

Khan :
reply from: z.khan@northeastern.edu

Hi Girish,

Yes. I always use incognito for this.

Just to be clear the username would just be the Khan.zu part right?

Cooke :
Hello Michael,

Do you have passwordless ssh setup from the login node to the compute node? That is one of the requirements for it x11 forwarding to work. 

Thank you,

Joseph

reply from: schwabe.m@northeastern.edu

Thanks for letting me know. These calculations are for an NSF grant update that is due tonight. I want to use srun to run vmd on an interactive node, but I am getting the cannot setup x11 forwarding error. Is there a way to fix this?

Cooke :
Hello Michael,

I made the changes to the actual application this morning and created the PR for a team member to review it. It will be live once a team member reviews it and I can publish it.

Thank you,

Joseph

Schwabe :
reply from: schwabe.m@northeastern.edu

Is there an ETA for when this update will be live?

Schwabe :
reply from: schwabe.m@northeastern.edu

I believe 8 hours should be sufficient.

Cooke :
Hello Michael,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. VMD runs on the gpu partition which has a maximum time limit of 8 hours. Apologies on the OOD form maxing out at 4 hours and I just created the change and pull request for the time to go up to 8 hours on the form. Is 8 hours sufficient for your analysis?

I will message when the change is tested and we push the update to OOD.

Thank you,

Joseph

Description : Hi,

The calculation of my program used to be much faster, I would like to know what is happening and when it will be fixed.

Thanks,
Kiarash

Cooke :
Hello Kiarash,

I am going to resolve the ticket since we haven't heard back from you in a bit. If you have any other questions please reach out to Research Computing at the following links: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/welcome/gettinghelp.html

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Kiarash,

I am reaching out to see if you had launched any other jobs after the consultation to see if the performance still remained normal? Just trying to get more information if it were only the set of jobs that you launched that had the slower performance. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Kiarash,

Thank you for booking a General Consultation with Research Computing. Below is a summary of the topics that we discussed in it.

1. You shared that your jobs were running significantly slower on Discovery, and you moved your work to another cluster because of a deadline.
2. You asked if there were issues with Discovery and if anything was happening that could be slowing the jobs down which I replied to the best of my knowledge nothing would be impacting your workflow.
3. I inquired if the change of the data set your jobs were running across would have changed the run time of the job and the performance.
4. You launched a job during the consultation and the job was running fine at that time. 
5. I said I would investigate your job history and see when the jobs were running and see if there was anything that could have caused this slow down to occur.

If you have any other questions, please reach out in this ticket and we can talk about it here.

Thank you,

Joseph

Farzad :
Hi Joseph,

Since the outputs are large files, they are all being written into the scratch.

Cooke :
Hello Kiarash,

Thank you for the comparison job ids. Looking over the batch script, it looks like you are writing your output to /scratch/farzad.k/naqfc_20230713/naqfc/output_offline_v54/${APPL}. Are all the output files being written here or are only the logs being written here? Just trying to get a feel of all the locations where files might be written to during the job along with the directories the program is trying to access.

Thank you,

Joseph

Farzad :
Joseph,

The recent slow one: slurm-37785069.log
The previous fast one: slurm-37709396.log

BTW, the loading time of my log file is incredibly high. I feel there is storage speed issues again on scratch. Just a feeling.

I am just running the job on another HPC just doing fine.

Cooke :
Hello Kiarash,

Could you give me jod ids to compare to when you said the same job was fine a few days back? 

Something like this job id (37783339 ) is slow but I ran the same job a few days ago (job id) and it ran as expected. I am looking at the job efficiency to see if something has changed between jobs but it is hard to find the corresponding job from your run history.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Kiarash,

Thank you for supplying the job ids. I will start looking them over and see if I notice a pattern as to what may have caused this. 

Have you loaded a different module when you noticed 'ls' not working properly or did you change your .bashrc?

Thank you,

Joseph

Farzad :
Hi Joseph,

It just started happening yesterday. Also, 'ls' was not working properly. The very same job was totally fine a few days back. 
Here are some samples:
37783339
37783706
37785069
37786112
37786505
37789563
37790303

It was very inconvenient for me to switch to another HPC, but since we have a report due. I have started migration for the time being. 

Thanks,

Cooke :
Hello Kiarash,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. I am sorry to hear that you are experiencing some different performance now in your calculations. Could you please provide some job ids that I can look into to see if I can see anything? When did you notice a performance change and did you change anything within the jobs that you are running? 

Thank you,

Joseph

Were you able to get the GPU node? Do you have any further queries regarding this?

Thanks,

RITM Update: Thank you for the prompt response.

Now I am able to generate the request. But my request is in queue.
How much time it will take to accept it?

Thanks,
Rahul

Sharma :
Hello Rahul,

I added myself to the reservation and was able to access 2 GPUs using the below command. Please try using the same and let me know if you are still seeing the error:

# srun -p reservation --reservation=rahul_test --gres=gpu:v100-sxm2:2 --time=24:00:00 -N 1 --pty --export=ALL /bin/bash

Thanks,
Paarthvi

Kumar :
RITM Update: Hello Paarthvi,

Thank you for providing the GPUs. But I am facing problem in accessing it.
I have attached the screenshot of the error. I am able to see the reservation but cannot use it. 
Please look into the matter and resolve it soon.

Thank you for your support.

Regards,
Rahul

Sharma :
Hi Rahul,

I've created a multi-gpu reservation for you on a multi-gpu node with 4 v100-sxm2 GPUs, starting 2 PM on 6/28, lasting until 6/30, 2 PM. I can extend it more if needed. Also, please note that it is not required for you to run long simulations or on a full data set, this is just to show that your application is able to scale on multiple GPUs compared to a single GPU, so you can use shorter calculations to save you some time.

To see reservation information, type:
# scontrol show reservations=rahul_test

ReservationName=rahul_test StartTime=2023-06-28T14:00:00 EndTime=2023-06-30T14:00:00 Duration=2-00:00:00
   Nodes=d1013 NodeCnt=1 CoreCnt=28 Features=(null) PartitionName=multigpu Flags=SPEC_NODES
   TRES=cpu=28
   Users=kumar.rahul4 Groups=(null) Accounts=(null) Licenses=(null) State=INACTIVE BurstBuffer=(null) Watts=n/a
   MaxStartDelay=(null)


To use the reservation, simply add the following:

1. If running an interactive job, to allocate all 4 GPUs for example, type:

# srun -p reservation --reservation=rahul_test --gres=gpu:v100-sxm2:4 --time=24:00:00 -N 1 --pty --export=ALL /bin/bash

2. To submit your jobs to the scheduler, add the following lines in your sbatch script:

#SBATCH -p reservation
#SBATCH --reservation=rahul_test
#SBATCH --time=24:00:00
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:v100-sxm2:4


Additionally, for reservations, you can use the following to see your running jobs:

# squeue -u <user_id> --all
# sacct -S now -u <user_id>

Let me know if you have any additional questions!

Thanks,
Paarthvi

Kumar :
RITM Update: Hello Paarthvi,
Thank you for the response.

Yes, I want to test on v100-sxm2 GPUs.  I want the reservation to start from June 28th at 2 pm.

Sharma :
Hello Rahul,

Thanks for reaching out to Research Computing with your request!

From your initial update, I see that you want to test on 2 GPUs. Please confirm if you would want to test on  v100-sxm2 GPUs. GPU related information is available here : https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/workingwithgpu.html

Also, please let us know when you would prefer for the reservation to start. Please note that we require at least 24 hours notice to ensure the full node will be available.

Thanks,
Paarthvi

Description : Hi there -

I am working with a program on the discovery cluster that outputs a html file. I'm wondering if it somehow possible to view this html file from where it is stored on discovery rather than having to download it and view it locally? Others in my lab have access to a development view that allows them to do this on the cluster (screenshot below).

Thank you!!!!
Best,
Akex

Hello Alex,

My apologies, I just copied the application over your your dev space in OOD. You will be able to access it now. I was initially asking if it would be okay to copy it over and was waiting to hear back prior to coping it. 

When you launch it for the first time, it will ask you to initialize the app and that is perfectly fine. Please let me know if it is working and if you have any other questions.

Thank you,

Hello Salah Mohammed Awad,

Thank you for your response. Please note that we have the TMUX module available in Xfer. you could use that to ensure that your current ssh session data doesn't get lost.
$tmux :
Inside the TMUX session, you can start the download as mentioned earlier.
ctrl + b  d. (Refer to TMUX cheatsheet link below) :
Whenever you want to check the progress of your download you can always log back into xfer and attach to the TMUX download session. $tmux at

This way you can avoid dependency on your laptop. More information about TMUX can be found here -

Hello Salah Mohammed Awad,


Please help me understand the situation better. Are you still trying to download the data or are you waiting for the data to download? Because for the first problem, I have already provided instructions on how to download the data. There seems to be no other authentication or parameters which are required for the wget command mentioned earlier. For the second problem, there's unfortunately, nothing I can do about that, xfer is the highest bandwidth node we offer currently.

Hello Salah Mohammed Awad,

Please note that data download involves transferring data from the internet to the cluster. Therefore, utilizing the xfer node is appropriate in this context. Below, I have outlined steps for downloading the dataset using the xfer node:

1. Access the xfer.discovery.neu.edu server from your local machine by executing the following command: ssh <username>@xfer.discovery.neu.edu
2. Login using your Northeastern password.
3. Proceed with the data download by executing the command: wget -c /work/amal-lab/DiagSet https://ai-econsilio.diag.pl/download-diagset-A/

Kindly be aware that the xfer node is specifically designed for high-bandwidth network downloads. It is strongly recommended to utilize the xfer node for this purpose. If you encounter any difficulties, please feel free to inform me.

reply from: s.al-heejawi@northeastern.edu

Hi Surya,
there is no torrent for the dataset, and I think this "xfer" is for transferring the data from cluster to another, not for downloading the data!
How is that going to help me? especially the data takes 3-6 days to be downloaded.
Is there a clear example to use Xfer?

Subject: Discovery Course Information

Hello,

Thank you for hosting your coursework on the Discovery cluster. We have some new features to help support courses this year:

  1.  Integration with Canvas — No need to send course rosters via CSV; we can pull these rosters from Canvas and add students, TAs, and teachers to your course groups automatically.
  2.  Standardized Unix Groups — There will be a single <course-code>.<term-code>-staff group comprised of all teachers and TAs for each course. Members of this Unix group will have read and write access to all files beneath the course directory. The students will have read and write access to courses/<course-code>.<term-code>/data and their username-specific directory under /students.
  3.  Per-Course Storage (by default) at /courses — We will automatically allocate 1TiB of storage to each course (if you need more storage, please let us know). This space will persist for the duration of the course and includes a directory, /data that all students can access.
  4.  Dedicated courses Partition — We now have a partition completely dedicated to courses with CPUs and/or GPUs depending on your course request. If we have developed an Open OnDemand app for your course, it will be hard-coded to use the course’s partition. If you are running commands on the command line or by using sbatch scripts, you will need to specify the partition with the -p courses flag. We have provided examples using srun and sbatch below for accessing the courses partition with CPUs and courses-gpu partition with GPUs :

     *   srun --partition=courses --pty /bin/bash
     *   #SBATCH --partition=courses
     *   srun --partition=courses-gpu --gres=gpu:1 --pty /bin/bash
     *   #SBATCH --partition=courses-gpu
     *   #SBATCH --gres=gpu:1

Your course and its related directories can be found via the file tree below:

/courses/

└── <course-code>.<term-code>

    ├── data

    ├── staff

    └── students

OOD Apps

We have three Open OnDemand (OOD) apps that appear at the top of the pull-down menu under “Courses” in the OOD Dashboard<https://ood.discovery.neu.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/>. These apps (Desktop, RStudio, JupyterLab) are available to students in any course using Discovery.

Courses with multiple sections

Please note, if your course is one out of several sections for the same course, all students and staff will be in the same main course directory. However, if you prefer to have sections separated in some way (with sub-directories in /data or /students) please reach out and let us know. We’re happy to accommodate these changes.

Additional questions or concerns: Contact us at rchelp@northeastern.edu<mailto:rchelp@northeastern.edu>, visit our website<http://rc.northeastern.edu/>, view our documentation<http://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/>, or check out our training page<https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/training/>.

Hi Kenneth, 

Our process is automatized and pulls data from canvas. So if the students are in canvas they will also be added to discovery and show up under students in your /courses directory once we rerun the script (runs once a day). However, as this process is still new can you provide a list of the new students so I can confirm that they are added?

Thank you,

I'm not sure I understand your last message. You currently have directories set up for your course here: 

/courses/CS6120.202410/ which include a /staff /students and shared /data directory. If there's anything else that you need you can respond to the message from my colleague Joseph on your classroom access request, which was sent Sept 7th.

Hi Kenneth, 

Yes all of the students who were in canvas for this class now have accounts on discovery. Please pass that and the course directory information on the them as we dont send a separate notice to them (but perhaps we should !). 

Also as this is a new process for us please let us now if there are any issues and we will revise them.

Hello. My student Atharva Vinay Sapre still has trouble access the work/brainvae folder. Could you double check his access?

Periaswamy :
Hello Seo Eun,

I'd like to inform you that we have successfully added student Atharva Vinay Sapre to the brainvae group. In the case of Atharva Joshi, please note that the approval for the USbill storage request is still pending. Once that goes through I will add the student to the group.

Hi Bhumika, 

I haven't heard from you in a week so I am closing this ticket. If you need additional help please open a new ticket or book a consultation here: https://outlook.office365.com/book/ResearchComputing2@northeastern.onmicrosoft.com/?ae=true

Caplins :
Hi Bhumika, 

Does it work when you type: ls $TINKER ? The command you want to use in your .bashrc is this:  export TINKER="/home/b.jayee/github/tinker/tinker/bin/"

Which you have but is commented out. Can you try removing the # and re-sourcing your .bashrc and trying it again?

You can also check that it's in your environment with but running: env | grep "TINKER"

Let me know if that works for you

Description : Hello,

My name is Joshua Baktay; I am a PhD student under Adrian Feiguin.

I am emailing to request that my maximum time allotted for jobs on the generic partition be extended, ideally up to a week. Currently, the “short” allows for only 24 hour jobs.

While I do have access to Dr. Feiguin’s partition, which allows for time up to 30 days, he only has 4 nodes allocated to his partition. While the number of jobs I need to run in a parallel are not extensive, they are greater than the capacity of Adrian’s 4 nodes.

If necessary, it would be acceptable for this to be a temporary allowance.

Best,
Joshua

Baktay :
Thank you so much for clarifying this. This makes sense and I will implement this practice moving forward.

Caplins :
Hi Joshua, 

Yes that is the correct link. Sorry I sent you one you didn't have access to. I see your request and we will start working on it soon. 

As far as your question about how many jobs can run on a node at a time. It depends on the resources that are being requested for each job and the resources that are available on the given node. 

For example, if there are 128 CPUs on a node and I launch one job requesting 128 CPUs, only that job can run. However, I could also submit 128 jobs that only request 1 CPU each and those would all be able to run at the same time. Ideally you are requesting the resources that your jobs need and not more than they need to maximize the efficiency of each node. 

If you're interested in checking the resources that a given job uses you can use either of the two commands below:

seff slurmjobid
sacct -P -n -a --format JobID,User,Group,State,Cluster,AllocCPUS,REQMEM,TotalCPU,Elapsed,MaxRSS,ExitCode,NNodes,NTasks -j <slurmjob_id>

Hope that helps!

Cheers, 
Serena

Baktay :
Hello, I have just submitted the application for the long partition. Please let me know if this is equivalent to the original your link you sent via intuit. Also, in addition to the question I last asked, should the application get rejected please let me know how I might change it to get approved; I am flexible on everything except the time.

Baktay :
I am submitting an application to the following link: https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0c34d402db0b0010a37cd206ca9619b7

Alternatively, it would be helpful to address the following question: for all partitions, can one node handle only one job at a time? Meaning, can Adrian's 4 nodes only handle 4 jobs at a time? This currently seems to be the case, as jobs from myself and other group members are queued under 'Resources' while the 4 jobs run. 

Understanding this is also revenant for filling out the above application properly. 

Thank you very much,
Joshua

Baktay :
The 'long' partition will be sufficient. However, the link you provided says I do not have access.

Caplins :
Hi Joshua, 

We recommend applying for the 'long' partition, which gives you a 5 day run time. Would that be sufficient? You will find the application form here: https://www.notion.so/nuits/RC-Service-Catalog-bitly-9b0c1b418085494591fa021ff0c74268

Alternatively,  we're happy to take a look at your code and provide assistance in optimizing it if you're interested in that. We find doing sufficient benchmarking can really improve the performance of parallel jobs to fit the run times that we have set in the partitions. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Description : Hi,

We are running low on space in /work/johnlab. Is it possible to get a space breakdown of folders in here, so we have an understanding of what we can do to maximize space?

Is it also possible to increase the storage on /work/johnlab?

Best regards,
Hoan Tran

Caplins :
Looks like I forgot to paste it in. Here it is. https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=334d36791b7cc8502dafc8415b4bcba9

At 35 TB you are at the limit of the free storage, so it would be setting up a discussion for payment for additional storage. Which we are happy to do. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Tran :
reply from: tran.hoan1@northeastern.edu

Thanks for the update!

Can you share the form again? I don't see it in here.

Best regards,
Hoan Tran

Caplins :
Hi Hoan,

My apologies for taking a while to get back to you. 

You can fill out this form to request additional space. It looks like you are at 27 TB of a 35 TB allocation.  

As for checking the size of different files in your directory. I suggest running a command like du -h --max-depth=1 in your /work/subdirectory. This will have to be done by the owners of each sub-directory individually. 

This will show this kind of output:
du -h --max-depth=1 /work/johnlab/Jixin
209G /work/johnlab/Jixin/csv_synced_split
5.3G /work/johnlab/Jixin/csv_synced_split_lab
5.6G /work/johnlab/Jixin/mims
0 /work/johnlab/Jixin/mims_distribution_pa_types
6.0K /work/johnlab/Jixin/paaws_study_intermediate
2.9M /work/johnlab/Jixin/scripts
220G /work/johnlab/Jixin

And another example: 
du -h --max-depth=1 /work/johnlab/CamSpades_ClusterEdition
525M /work/johnlab/CamSpades_ClusterEdition/Annotations
0 /work/johnlab/CamSpades_ClusterEdition/Fall2022_Annotators
790G /work/johnlab/CamSpades_ClusterEdition/VideoData
797G /work/johnlab/CamSpades_ClusterEdition

And this one (is long): du -h --max-depth=1 /work/johnlab/DATASETS_PROJECT

Description : Hello,
Thank you for introducing the HPC at the New Faculty Orientation last week! I asked a question about whether there may possibly be support for obtaining and managing sharing large, open datasets (e.g., https://www.ukbiobank.ac.uk/) that multiple groups across the university may use, in order to prevent multiple groups from downloading and managing the same datasets independently. There seemed to be interest from your office, so I just wanted to follow up and see what possibilities may look like moving forward.

I was given an account on the Discovery cluster. I'm a postdoc and my lab has a group on the cluster (kwonlab_hc). My advisor approved the creation of the cluster account, however I don't have permissions/access for kwonlab_hc. Would you be able to grant access, or advise on how to apply?

Thank you!

Description : Hi RC help group,

My name is Qingchu Jin, a research scientist at Roux Institute, northeastern university actively working with discovery cluster. I was using the Rstudio on OOD before, where I used the R/4.2.1 all the time. However, when I am trying to use R on the cluster and do sbatch submission, there isn't an available R/4.2.1 version. I am quite confused.

Additionally, when I tried to use R/4.2.0 through the command line, and install glmnet. It provides me the following error:

Error: C++17 standard requested but CXX17 is not defined
* removing ‘/home/q.jin/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.2/glmnet’
* restoring previous ‘/home/q.jin/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.2/glmnet’

The downloaded source packages are in
        ‘/tmp/Rtmpiz2FVX/downloaded_packages’

If would be if you can help me understand this.

Best regards,
Qingchu

Hello Qingchu,

Thank you for letting me know and I am going to resolve this ticket. If you have any other questions please let us know at the following links: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/welcome/gettinghelp.html

Thank you,

Joseph

Jin :
No problem. That’s it. Thanks

Cooke :
Hello Qingchu,

I am glad to hear it worked and apologies on providing the wrong path previously. Do you have any follow up questions or can I resolve this ticket?

Thank you,

Joseph

Jin :
Awesome. It works this time.

Cooke :
Hello Qingchu,

My apologies, I mistyped the path to the container. Could you please try the following:

/shared/container_repository/rstudio/rocker-tidyverse-4.2.1.sif R

Thank you,

Joseph

Jin :
Hi Joseph, 

I tried the interactive mode using srun. In the interactive node, I am able to run module load singularity/3.5.3

However, it gives me the error once I run the following command. singularity exec -B "/work:/work,/scratch:/scratch" /shared/containers_repository/rstudio/rocker-tidyverse-4.2.1.sif R

The error is:  FATAL:   could not open image /shared/containers_repository/rstudio/rocker-tidyverse-4.2.1.sif: failed to retrieve path for /shared/containers_repository/rstudio/rocker-tidyverse-4.2.1.sif: lstat /shared/containers_repository: no such file or directory

Cooke :
Hello Qingchu,

I am just reaching out to see if you were able to use the container in your workflow and if you encountered any issues.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Qingchu,

You are welcome and please let me know if this works and if you run into any problems that I can assist with. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Jin :
Thanks for these information. Will test it tonight and send you feedback

Cooke :
Hello Qingchu,

I am just reaching out to see if you were able to try out using the container and seeing if that fits the workflow you are trying to complete on Discovery.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Qingchu,

Thank you for letting me know and no worries, I will type up the commands here for you to try and see if this works for you.

If you want to use the container and R interactively on the command line you can use an srun session (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/r.html#creating-a-packrat-environment-for-r):

srun -N 1 -n 12 --time=04:00:00 --mem=2G --pty /bin/bash

Then you will want to module load singularity:

module load singularity/3.5.3

then make the singularity call:

singularity exec -B "/work:/work,/scratch:/scratch" /shared/containers_repository/rstudio/rocker-tidyverse-4.2.1.sif R

which will start the R command up from within the container and you will have an interactive session in R. 

If you are using sbatch (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/r.html#creating-a-packrat-environment-for-r) to submit your job you can do the following:

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH -N 1
#SBATCH -n 12
#SBATCH --time=04:00:00
#SBATCH --mem=2G

module load singularity/3.5.3

singularity exec -B "/work:/work,/scratch:/scratch" /shared/containers_repository/rstudio/rocker-tidyverse-4.2.1.sif Rscript <your-R-script-name>

where <your-R-script-name> is the Rscript that you are trying to run. 

If you are trying to install R packages in your environment we recommend using packrat (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/r.html#creating-a-packrat-environment-for-r) and you can make sure in your Rscript that you are activating your packrat environment. To build the environment I would use the srun command to build and install your packages and then you can run them using sbatch.

Please let me know if this helps and if you need anything clarified in the process but R functions the same in the container as it does on the cluster but you just need to call it slightly differently.

Thank you,

Joseph

Jin :
Hi Joseph,

Not sure what RStudion or Geospatial is. I do use TidyVerse of RStudio in OOD.

No, sorry, I don't have experience using container or singularity. Only heard about it.

Thank you.
Qingchu

Cooke :
Hello Qingchu,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing.  The RStudio version on OOD is running in a container on Discovery which is why we have a newer version on OOD. Which flavor (RStudion, TidyVerse, or Geospatial) of RStudio were you using on OOD?

We can call the container from the command line in an srun job or in a sbatch job and still use the same environment. Have you used containers or Singularity in the past? 

If you let me know the RStudio flavor you were using on OOD, I will write out the path and command that you will run to use that version of R on Discovery in srun and sbatch jobs.

Thank you,

Joseph

Description : Hello folks,

I’m a grad student in Jing-Ke Weng’s Lab, and I’ve been working with Greg, Joseph, and Serena to facilitate the transfer of data over from our current location at Whitehead.  It was decided that I should get an early account (before we all get NEU student accounts) so that I can get logged on to the cluster.  I’ve submitted a form requesting an account and Jing-Ke approved it.  However, when I try to claim my account, my credentials are rejected.  (One possibility is that somebody might have entered my name as Kate when I used Kathleen, or something like that.  I have tried many combinations.)  Can somebody help me out?

Many thanks,
Kate

Hi Kate, 

I see Dr. Weng has gotten in touch with us regarding the data transfer. Since this ticket was open for access to your discovery account, and you now have access. I'm going to close it here and allow the transfer communication to happen on the other ticket. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Hi Greg,

Just following up — how are we looking on the globus transfer?  We’re due to start our move in about three weeks.

We have recently updated globus and are in the process of making additional improvements to how globus works at NEU and have delayed some large data transfers using globus until that set up is finished. I have discussed this with our system admin (I mentioned it to him last Friday). So we definitely haven't forgotten but being that the data you want to transfer is so large we're taking some steps to improve the process so it doesn't impact other users on the cluster.

Hi Greg,

I successfully claimed my account in early August. Now we’re just waiting to initiate the Globus transfer. Can you give me a sense of when that might be possible?

Thanks,
Kate

hello kate-

we do not have any visibility into the account-claim process. 
can you reach out to the Service Desk ? this is their area of
expertise and they should be able to help you out pretty quickly.

Hi Kate, 

Let me ask Greg and get back to you. Hopefully we'll be able to catch-up quickly once things are running efficiently.

Hi Serena,

I’ll look into that, thank you!

It would be great to know a little more about the data transfer timeline.  We were really hoping to finish the transfer well in advance of late October (when we officially leave Whitehead), and we were under the impression that Globus would take weeks to months to run.  Are we still on track for that deadline?

Best,
Kate

We have recently updated globus and are in the process of making additional improvements to how globus works at NEU and have delayed some large data transfers using globus until that set up is finished. I have discussed this with our system admin (I mentioned it to him last Friday). So we definitely haven't forgotten but being that the data you want to transfer is so large we're taking some steps to improve the process so it doesn't impact other users on the cluster.

Description : Hi Rchelp,

I started an jupyter note book but it just keeps me waiting and my job still sits in the queue.

The notebook id is 37334938 and session id is fe9dd2f5-f0ae-4812-9f83-e3a4d05434b2<https://ood.discovery.neu.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/files/fs/home/wu.zongyu/ondemand/data/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/jupyterlab/output/fe9dd2f5-f0ae-4812-9f83-e3a4d05434b2>.

Could you check what’s happening with it?

And I’m also downloading a 352 gb dataset to the server, but it says my connection to the remote server has been terminated when it goes to 43%. Could you also let me know why this is happening? And can I restart downloading again from 43% instead of from the beginning?

Thank you,
Zongyu

Hi Prasanth,

Thank you, I'll try with less cpus. 

And for downloading, I used this command wget -P /work/amal-lab/DiagSet download_link, and tried to resume by wget —continue -P /work/amal-lab/DiagSet.

But although it gives error when I used this command , when I check it later the downloading is already finished and I dont' know why. 

I will try unpacking it now. 

Thank you,
Zongyu

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hello Zongyu,

Thank you for reaching out to RC.

Regarding your Jupyter Notebook issue, it seems that you're requesting 28 CPU cores for a GPU node. that might be the reason  why your job is remaining in the queue. As a guideline for JupyterLab, we typically recommend not requesting more than 12 CPU cores when using a GPU.  We mentioned that under the CPUs field as a note "Enter the number of CPUs (up to 128 CPUs without GPU, up to 12 with a GPU)."
 It might help to adjust your request to align with this recommendation, and then resubmit your job.

As for the data transfer issue, could you provide us with more details about how you are transferring the data? Are you using Globus, FileZilla, or another method? Also, could you let us know the destination directory where you are trying to store this data? It would help us ensure that there is sufficient storage space in that directory.

When it comes to resuming the download, the ability to do so depends on the method of transfer you are using. For instance, if you are using rsync or Globus, you should be able to resume the transfer from where it was interrupted. Please let us know the method so we can provide more specific advice.

Thank you for your patience. We're here to assist you.

Best,
Prasanth

Hi Yiwen, 

What size data are you trying to transfer? We find the file application on the Open on Demand can be slow for large datasets. You may try using one of the methods in our documentation (scp for example) https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/datamanagement/transferringdata.html

Hello Goretti,

I hope you are doing well. It seems that the procedures you are currently following to develop a sandbox OOD app might be incorrect. Allow me to outline the proper procedure for you:

1. Begin by Git cloning or downloading a pre-built OOD App (e.g., JupyterLab, RStudio, etc.) to the ~/ondemand/dev/ directory.
2. Modify the application to run on Discovery. This involves editing the form.yml and submit.yml.erb files. Check out this documentation for more detailed instructions: https://osc.github.io/ood-documentation/latest/tutorials/tutorials-interactive-apps/add-jupyter.html
3. Once you've completed the modifications, open the sandbox section in the Open OnDemand portal: https://ood.discovery.neu.edu/
4. Finally, run the application in the sandbox environment.

I hope these steps prove helpful to you. If you encounter any further issues, don't hesitate to schedule a consultation with me. We can then delve into the matter in more detail: https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/

Surya

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. You should have your My Sandbox Apps (Development) in Open OnDemand. It is located in the top row of items and it is marked 'Develop', Do you have any specific questions on the Development environment? I just checked to see if you have a ~/ondemand/dev directory and you do.

Description : Hello sir/madam,

I am reaching out regarding installing packages on discovery. I am trying to run a python script that needs

Hello Tina,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. I am sharing the following documentation on using conda to install python packages on Discovery (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/conda.html). You can install packages in directories that you have write permissions to and that is where pip was probably failing. I tried the following and was able to install both network-x and graph-tools so if you could try the following as well:

srun --pty /bin/bash
module load anaconda3/2022.05
conda create -n graphtools python=3.9 -y
source activate graphtools
conda install -c anaconda networkx -y
conda install -c conda-forge graph-tool -y

Thank you,

Description : Hi,

I'm interested in using the computational resources at Northeastern University to carry on an exploratory project on AI and malaria detection.

We use segmentation techniques to help determining whether images of cells contain the parasite that causes the disease. Segmentation is performed with a commercially available neural network called trainYolo.

I'd like to apply for a computational allocation at the Discovery cluster, but I'm not sure what is the process, nor whether there's a cost associated with an allocation.

Thanks
Miguel

Shomo :
those are all good-people and that is good-news ;)

i'll resolve this ticket (if that is OK), but please just open 
up a new ticket as things move forward.

[greg]

Fuentes-Cabrera :
reply from: m.fuentes-cabrera@northeastern.edu

Hi Greg,

Thanks. I just submitted a request access.

I used to work at the Oak Ridge National Laboratory and had access to an allocation in NERSC until recently. At NERSC, we tried trainYolo on Perlmutter, and it worked very well. We could not get much out of Google Colab, by contrast.

I think the Discovery Cluster will be a great resource for our project. I worked in many other research projects too, as I still have many collaborations in ORNL. I'm sure I'll make good use of the Discovery Cluster.

Thanks again!
Miguel

Shomo :
hello miguel && thank you for reaching out to RC !

the application process is pretty simple and i suggest
following https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/gettingstarted/index.html.

in general, everyone at NU can use the discovery cluster 
for research, etc. at no cost. that includes a fair number of
gpus (of various vintage) and 35T of storage. if you find that
your research requires more resources than we have available
in the general partitions, then there are a couple of options :

1. purchase hardware to be integrated with the cluster (condo-style)
2. purchase gpu-hours for dedicated resource-access (airbnb-style ?!?)

most groups find that the free resources are sufficient for their
work and never need to consider those options, so i suggest starting
there and let's see how it goes !

please let me know if you have any additional questions
&& happy computing !
[greg]

ps. i am not sure how trainYolo fits into on-prem computation.
perhaps it is obvious, but nothing jumped out at me from a quick
glance at their pricing page. do you have that part figured out already ?

Hi Joydeep,

Thanks for reaching out to RC regarding this.

For installing software packages like qutip, we typically ask our users to create a conda environment and then do `pip install qutip` 

See https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/packagemanagers/conda.html#conda

Have you tried that approach? It might be more efficient to book a consultation with me and do the installation there. You can do so by going to https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/

Hi Rajagopal, 

Yes they will be able to upload datasets and code files. They will also get full access to Discovery for the duration of the course. This means they will have a directory under /home and /scratch as well as one under our courses which in your case will be /courses/CS5100.202410/students/$USERNAME

And you will have the same but a directory under /courses/CS5100.202410/staff

There will also be a shared /data directory that the students have read access to and you have read and write access. So if you want to put data there that everyone in the course can access. 

So they can do things in the command line, build their own conda environments, use modules etc. 

Any other questions?

Cheers, 
Serena

Venkatesaramani :
are students able to upload datasets and code files as well :

Caplins :
Hi Rajagopal,

Thank you again for submitting your classroom request. I wanted to ask if you need an application to accompany your classroom request?

For example I can install the packages you listed in a conda environment which you can access via a Jupyterlab app, which would be accessible on the Open On Demand app under 'courses'. Would that be sufficient for your needs?

We typically ask for a few days to 1 week to complete classroom requests, but I will try and have things set up for you by the end of this week.
Many thanks,

Serena Caplins

Hi Yael,

Thanks for reaching out to RC regarding this. The Disk quota exceeded error means that you are over quota on your $HOME. The current limit on the disk space for all our users is 75GB and you are above that. 

Please follow our guidelines on https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/homequota.html

to delete some of the folders and bring your quota under 75GB. In order to see the disk usage for your folders on $HOME, you can do the following:

1. srun --pty /bin/bash
2. du -shc .[^.]* ~/*

Let me know if that helped.

Hi Archana, 

I don't see any error messages in the output.log from Rstudio on your end. Can you try clearing your browser cache and/or restarting the web server? You can restart the web server by going to the On Demand Dashboard and under the "Develop" tab selecting "restart web server".  You're browser cache can be cleared by finding the option to clear browsing data, which will depend somewhat on which browser you're using. I would try restarting the On Demand server first and testing that before clearing your browser data. 

Then try relaunching an Rstudio session and see if that works. 

Let me know if you have any questions.

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Jonathan,

Thanks for reaching out to RC regarding this. Our current language, as of Jan 2023, for institutional resources and data management plan is the following. Feel free to take whatever  is required.
===========================================================================

The Northeastern ITS Research Computing (RC) team provides high-end research computing resources to all Northeastern University affiliated faculty, researchers, and students. The team also manages Northeastern’s partnership with the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC). Resources available to the Northeastern community include a centralized high performance computing (HPC) cluster, storage, software, high-level technical and scientific consultations, education, documentation, and training. All of these resources are available to all faculty and students, with RC staff available to assist researchers through consultations on how to leverage hardware and software for scientific applications and workflows.

As of January 2023, the Discovery cluster provides access to over 45,000 CPU cores and over 400 GPUs to all Northeastern faculty and students free of charge.  Hardware currently available for research consists of a combination of Intel Xeon (Cascadelake, Skylake_avx512, Broadwell, Haswell, Sandybridge and Ivybridge) and AMD (Zen, Zen2) CPU microarchitectures. Additionally, a selection of NVIDIA Pascal (P100), Volta (V100), Turing (T4), and Ampere (A100) GPUs.  Discovery is connected to the university network over 10 Gbps Ethernet (GbE) for high-speed data transfer, and Discovery provides 6 PB of available storage on a high-performance file system. Compute nodes are connected with either 10 GbE or high data rate InfiniBand (200 Gbps or 100 Gbps), supporting all types and scales of computational workloads.

A dedicated team of PhD scientists and staff manage the RC environment and support researchers in their use of the Discovery cluster resources. The RC team updates computational resources available through Discovery with the newest technologies on a yearly cycle to support the cutting-edge research being performed by Northeastern faculty and students.

Research groups who require access to dedicated computational resources can request to be part of a “buy-in” option, integrating their hardware into the Discovery cluster to provide unified access to both private and shared compute nodes for their research group members. Faculty-owned hardware that is part of the Discovery cluster is fully managed and maintained by the RC staff at no charge.

Alternatively, researchers can transfer grant dollars to RC to enable a ‘Co-op’ or paid allocations model. Principal Investigators (PIs) can purchase CPU or GPU hours, or storage capacity, tailored to the specific needs of a research project and/or grant. This alleviates the need for PIs to purchase capital equipment directly.


## Data Management Plan (DMP)
--------------------------------------------
The Research Computing Team at Northeastern University ([www.rc.northeastern.edu](https://www.rc.northeastern.edu/)) provides research groups with up to 35 TB of high-performance data storage free of charge. This storage is owned and maintained by the University and is physically located in the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center, a secure data center. All storage systems are on uninterruptible power supply (UPS)-backed power supplies, so that in the event of a power outage or interruption, there can be a graceful shutdown, minimizing the possibility of data loss. All storage file systems are backed up several times daily, and in certain cases, a second offsite copy is maintained. For secure, reliable data access, the Research Computing team maintains a Globus endpoint on Discovery that can be used by researchers to access and share their data.

The University provides website hosting for students, staff, and faculty, free of charge. Through https://sites.northeastern.edu/ anyone at NU can create a basic WordPress site. For more complex website needs, the university also has a dedicated team of web developers who can assist faculty and staff with their website needs.

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Mojtaba,

Thanks for reaching out to RC regarding this. For Python versions, we have few modules that go as high as 3.8.1 with the default version for any node in the cluster being 2.7.5. The reason is that if you load any of the anaconda3 modules, then you will automatically get the python version that comes with that anaconda module. So for example, if you do: 
module load anaconda3/2022.05 
python --version

You will see that the python version is 3.9.12.

Typically, if you load an anaconda module and then create a conda environment based on the python version you want, you should be all set. 
See https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/conda.html

So you can do something like: 
srun --partition=short --nodes=1 --cpus-per-task=1 --pty /bin/bash

module load anaconda3/2022.05

conda create --prefix=/<path>/<environment-name> python=3.11 (if you want to create a conda environment with python 3.11 version but without the entire anaconda distribution installed in that environment)

source activate /<path>/<environment-name> 

If you want to stick with pipenv, you can still go ahead and install the python version you want at the time of creation of the pipenv. 
See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/50161551/set-python-version-when-creating-virtualenv-using-pipenv

So something like, pipenv install --python 3.11

I would recommend using either conda or pip env but not one inside of another as that can lead to errors with location of certain base packages in conflict with one another. 

Hope that helped. But if you would like to discuss this further, feel free to book a consultation with me using https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/

Description : Hi,


I would like to ask if discovery supports SFTP, I hope to use pycharm's remote connection to synchronize files.

But I tried to connect and found that I can access discovery through SSH, but I can’t connect to it through SFTP. There is no problem with local sftp, because I can access other Host servers through sftp.
[cid:aedb7a53-c671-42d8-8433-ea0a5c63d0f1]

Or what operations do I need to perform on discovery, such as creating a user group to enable the SFTP protocol.


Thanks,

Shanshan

Shenoy :
Hello Shanshan,

Thank you for contacting RC with your query. The discovery cluster does support SFTP but it is not supported through all nodes. SFTP is supported via the xfer nodes, more information on it can be found at https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html.

in short you can connect to the cluster via SFTP, for that you will have to login using the following
sftp <username>@xfer.discovery.neu.edu

I hope this helps. Do let me know if I can help you with something else.

Thank you,
Prajwal

hello arjun-

thank you for reaching out to RC !

it looks like somebody beat me to this, 
but anders should be all set after 0854 EDT
today.

it takes a couple of hours for new unix groups
to propagate throughout the cluster, so 
@Freeman, Anders please be sure to logout
of any open sessions (after 0854 EDT) and log
back in. 

for OOD, please choose "restart webserver"
from the "developer" menu in the top-menubar
(again, after 0854). 

let us know i f you have any questions
&& happy computing !

Hello Binod,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. The error message you are receiving is because Open OnDemand creates log files for each session you open and you are currently over your $HOME quota so it cannot create those log files. Everyone has a $HOME quota of 75 GB and you are currently at 82 GB. 

If you run the following command in your $HOME directory:

du -shc .[^.]* * 

you will get the following output:

You have some large sub directories that could be cleaned up such as .cache if you have no jobs running. Also we recommend storing research related work in a /work directory related to the project that you are working on with your PI. 

Here are some links to our documentation about cleaning up conda environments and your $HOME that might be helpful.

https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/homequota.html
https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/conda.html

After you get your quota below 75 GB, you will be able to open up a JupyterLab session.

Thank you,

Joseph

Shomo :
hello junaid-

tbank you for reaching out to RC !

there are only a few nodes with 1.6TB of memory,
so your job will have to queue up until one of those
nodes is free. it doesn't help that the job requires
3 days to complete, but once the scheduler can 
fit it in, it will.

if you run `scontrol show job $jobid`, you will notice
that there is a start time for one of the jobs. that is
the latest time at which the job will execute and if
other jobs finish up early, your job may start early.

i hope that helps

Pillai :
Hi Murtaza,

Thanks for reaching out to Research Computing.

To access Discovery, you must first have an account. You can request an account through ServiceNow but need a Northeastern username and password. If you are new to the university or a visiting researcher, you should work with your sponsor to obtain a Northeastern username and password.

HPC users need a sponsor, usually a NU PI or professor, to approve their request. Students (undergraduate or graduate), visiting researchers, or staff members must have a sponsor approve their request. When you fill out the ServiceNow form, an email is sent to the specified sponsor upon submitting the request. Sponsors will receive email reminders until they approve the request through the link in the email to ServiceNow. We recommend letting your sponsor know to look for the email with the approval link before submitting an access request.

To request an account, follow these steps:
Visit the ServiceNow RC Access Request form : https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0ae24596db535fc075892f17d496199c

Complete the form, check the acknowledgment box, and submit it.

Your request may take up to 24 hours after your sponsor approves it. You will receive an email confirmation when your access has been granted. 

Let me know if you have any additional queries.

Regards,
Girish Pillai

Caplins :
Hi Hitanshu, 

Thank you. It looks like it is writing to a temp folder. These temp folders are created when R is run and only exist per session. You must be hitting the internal limit of that temporary directory.  I'm actually not sure what that limit is but will look into it. 

This starts when you run the command download_files(). 

It would probably be better to direct that data somewhere else so you don't overfill the tmp directory. 

You can do this by creating a file called .Renviron which will contain the following:

TMPDIR="/scratch/$USER"

Then in R you can check that it's looking in the right place with:

tempdir()

That should return the path you set in the .Renviron file. Scratch is a good place because it has a very high limit and is purged every 28 days.

Alternatively, and probably an even better option is to set the download file location in the download_files() command itself. However, I'm not familiar with that command (and haven't found it online). Is that a function you wrote yourself?

You will want to be careful with when you direct the tmp directory to be your /scratch as you will start to collect files there for each R session you run. Also because it is purged every 28 days you should direct data you want to keep to a location on /work. 

Hope that helps, 
Serena

Hi Hitanshu,

Do you mind providing your R script so I can take a look? Where is it writing the output file to? 

I thought this may be due to not enough space in your home directory but I did check and that's not the issue. So we will have to look closer at the script itself. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Pandit :
I am not how to go about it, Can you suggest a resource for R quota limit check?

Pandit :
Yes, I tried running a small sample to my R session. However, I received this error

"Error: IOError: Error writing bytes to file. Detail: [errno 28] No space left on device
In addition: There were 29 warnings (use warnings() to see them)
Called from: csv___WriteCSV__RecordBatchReader(x, write_options, sink)"

I am having hard time understanding how can disk be out of space when I asked for a 120GB RAM?

Also, R has 4.3.1 version but the ondemand sessions has only 4.2.1 and the job has only 4.2.0? Can I expect some update?

Shomo :
it's /etc/profile.d/modules.sh (ie, in the plural) also.

Caplins :
Hi Hitanshu,

Thank you for contacting RC with your request. Please see below for a few corrections that need to be made to your sbatch script. I also notice that --mem=548g is a lot of memory for an R job. Have you tested it with lower values? It will sit in the queue for a while before running with such a large request. It may be better to request a small amount of memory and make sure that your code will run before asking for more. 


R needs to be capitalized to load the module

module add R/4.2.0

An R script can be executed in a sbatch script with the following:

Rscript $R_SCRIPT


Hope that helps!

Cheers, 
Serena

RITM Update: Hello Paarthvi, 

I discussed with my advisor, she clarified that the quantum mechanical calculations we are running cannot be checkpointed, and we will need access to the long queue to finish the jobs. Sorry for the confusion. 

Thanks, 
Colin

Sharma :
Hello Colin,

Thanks for reaching out to RC with your request!

The long partition is designed to meet the needs of researchers who have code that needs to run longer than 24 hours and that cannot be checkpointed.
The idea behind checkpointing is to be able to run multiple shorter jobs rather than submitting a single long job. It is usually done by saving the latest calculation stage into a checkpoint file, so the next job can load it and continue from the latest stage of the run. This prevents you from losing your data in case a job crashes and allows to monitor and analyze your data frequently. Additionally, it allows to avoid partition time limits.

We see that you have mentioned that the workflow be checkpointed. Have you tried doing the same? If yes, is long partition still required and why?

Thanks,
Paarthvi

We have shared Storage (name: aims), I have access to that through moboxterm and ood. But My supervisor asked me to connect through windows ( add it like a drive to computer).

I tried it as told in 'https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/', but it didn't work. Can you help me with what is the problem or how can I do that.

Best,
Mehdi

Caplins :
Hi Mehdi, 

Yes sorry for the delay in responding. They page you've linked to is deprecated and we unfortunately no longer support adding /research as a drive to your windows machine. As an alternative you can use sshfs to connect to your windows machine. Please see our updated documentation on file transfer.  https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html

Feel free to reach out for more information or book a consultation if you require more assistance. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Hi,

Good morning, I wanted to follow up with you. Did you figure this out?

Best,

Caplins :
HI Mehdi, 

Thank you for the additional information. That helps a lot. I will work on this today and get back to you.

Here is the error I get ( I attached it). I checked different variation of too, but it still doesn't work.

Caplins :
Hi Mehdi, 

Thank you for contacting RC with this request. I am a little uncertain what you are asking for. If you can access it through mobaxterm that should also work on Windows. Are you trying to map discovery as a drive to your windows computer?

Can you provide more detail on what you tried to do in regards to the documentation that you linked? What exactly did you try?

Also happy to have a consultation with you if that would be more helpful for providing clarity on the issue. https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/

Cheers,

Pillai :
Hi Eugenia,

Just an update.
To set the minimum and maximum stack size, you can also use the following command after compiling your program.
>>>> java -Xms2g -Xmx4g testJavaProgram

Also, make sure you run the program on a compute node with enough memory.

Thanks,
Girish Pillai

Pillai :
Hi Eugenia,

Thank you for your patience.
You can access the installation script from the below folder with the following command:
vim /scratch/g.pillai/java_script_test/installJava.sh

Duplicate the file's contents and paste them into a new shell script in your /work directory, where you intend to perform the Java installation. Be sure to customize the java_install_dir to your preferred directory path before executing the script.

After updating the java_install_dir variable to your desired location, you can execute the script using the following command: 
>>>> sh installJava.sh.

Once the script has been executed, you can activate the Java environment exclusively for the current shell session by sourcing the installJava.sh script:
>>>>  source installJava.sh

After sourcing make sure to check the Java version using the following command:
>>>> java --version

You can execute you Java program with the following command
java -Xss<size> YourJavaProgram

Replace <size> with the stack size value you want to set. The stack size value can be specified in various units such as kilobytes (K or KB), megabytes (M or MB), and gigabytes (G or GB). For example, to set the stack size to 1024 megabytes, you can use :
>>>> java -Xss1024M YourJavaProgram

This will run YourJavaProgram with a stack size of 1024 megabytes for each thread created by the JVM.

Do let me know if you face any issues while installing.

Thanks and regards,
Girish Pillai

Perekhodko :
RITM Update: reply from: e.perekhodko@northeastern.edu

Hi Girish,

Yes, that would be great.
Let me know when you will install it.

All the best,
Eugenia

Get Outlook for iOS<https://aka.ms/o0ukef>

Pillai :
Hi Eugenia,
I believe the HotSpot JVM provided by Oracle will allow you to increase the stack size significantly beyond the default limits.

Best,
Girish

Perekhodko :
RITM Update: reply from: e.perekhodko@northeastern.edu

Hi Girish,

yes, I need to install Java for the experiments. The only condition that I need to have is that JVM could allow me to increase the stack size for more than 1G (-Xss flag).
Can you please check that the version of Java you will install will allow me to do this?

thank you,
Eugenia

Pillai :
Hey Eugenia,

Thanks for reaching out to Research Computing.
So  if I am not wrong, you just need Java installed for your experiments?

But it looks like the real culprit is your .local folder which has 45G. This is usually from doing pip installs but can be do to other uses. 

We also recommend making conda environments in your /work directory if you have one.

I am afraid the number of unnecessary tools/packages I have installed has made it difficult to recover manually. Isn’t there any procedure to delete an account and reissue a new one?

Thanks,
Mojtaba

Caplins :
Hi Mojtaba, 

Yes it looks like most of the space in your home is used by the .cache and .conda. You can see this yourself with this command here:

du -h --max-depth=1 /home/yousefi.m

The limit in /home is 75 GBs. You have a total of 193 GBs. 

We don't formally 'reset' accounts, but you can delete files that you no longer need or want. It is safe to delete your .cache as long as you're not currently running any processes. This can be done with the command: rm -rf .cache

However, take care with the rm command as it is permanent. We offer some additional guidelines to keep under quota here: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/homequota.html

Cheers, 
Serena

Description : Hi,

Im trying to create get dcm2bids and dcm2niix to work on the cluster. I have a conda environment already created but the dcm2niix isn’t working.

This is about how to convert dcm files to bids on discovery cluster

1. Install dcm2bids and dcm2niix
srun --pty /bin/bash
module purge
module load discovery
module load anaconda3/2022.05
conda create --prefix=/work/cnelab/code/conda-dcm2bids-1 python=3.9 anaconda
source activate /work/cnelab/conda-dcm2bids
conda install -c conda-forge dcm2bids
conda install -c conda-forge dcm2niix
#once installed previously only run
source activate /work/cnelab/code/conda-dcm2bids-1

2. Test if the tools were installed properly
dcm2bids -h
dcm2niix -h

Im not sure what is going on. Could you please help?

Additionally, I tried redoing the conda environment and re creating it. I am getting this error “    OSError: [Errno 122] Disk quota exceeded: '/home/tinney.e/.conda/pkgs/cache/9e0f62c3.json'”

Caplins :
Hi Emma, 

What errors are you seeing when you do step 2? 
Thank you for including the instructions you follow to create the environment. They seemed to work on my end with slight modifications (I think you're missing a -1 at the end of the first source activate step). I got an error at the conda create step that the anaconda package wasn't available from current channels so I removed it and ran it as:
 conda create --prefix=/scratch/s.caplins/conda-dcm2bids-1 python=3.9

I suspect the overall issue is that your /home is over the quota of 75GB. Please see our documentation on steps you can follow. https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/homequota.html#home-directory-storage-quota

Let's start with cleaning up your home and then go from there on setting up these programs. 

Cheers,

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Brianne,

Thanks for reaching out to RC regarding this. Apologies for a tardy response as we are currently understaffed. 

I just checked and I'm being able to launch sas using OOD and directly from the Discovery terminal after loading the sas/9.4 module. Would any of those method work for you?

Thanks for sharing the link to the website that has outdated information. I've reached out to our Documentation Specialist to take care of multiple broken links that are currently shown on that page. 

In the meantime, please try to access SAS using one of the following 2 options:

1. https://ood.discovery.neu.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sessions
You would need to log in using your Discovery credentials

2. Log into Discovery using a terminal via X11 forwarding: ssh -Y b.mui@login.discovery.neu.edu
     Jump to a compute node on the short partition, if you don't need GPU access: srun --pty /bin /bash
     Load SAS: module load sas/9.4
     Launch SAS: sas

Let me know if that helped. You can also book a consultation with me if you need further assistance with this. See https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/

Cooke :
Hello Tong,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. The error you are receiving is because OOD creates log files when it opens up the job sessions and your /home space is over quota. Everyone has a 75 GB quota and you are currently at 84 GB. 

I would focus on cleaning up your .conda directory with some tips found here (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/conda.html and https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/homequota.html) and you can safely remove your .cache directory if you are not running any jobs. Also if you are working on research related work with a PI, you can have research related work in their /work directory. 

I found out the directory sizes with the following command: du -shc .[^.]* *

7.5K    .bash_history
512     .bash_logout
512     .bash_profile
1.0K    .bashrc

Description : Hi Team,

I am from Northeastern supply chain Data Hub team. We have requested Greg for a publicly accessible server. While discussing specifications, we mentioned we will be using few ports in range 8000 – 8080.

Now, we are trying to set up proxy for forwarding all requests of the server we got to 8000 port using nginx. We are sure that configuration and setup is correct for nginx as we are also using same script in our other server as well which is working fine.

Server Name: scooter.rc.northeastern.edu

We wanted to make sure if any firewall settings are stopping our requests. Please let us know if any other information required to debug the issue.

Description : Good afternoon,

For my research I need to use the package pyspi in a Jupyter notebook. So I tried to create a conda environment (called pyspi_2) which has python 3.9.0, anaconda3/2022.05 and the pyspi and jupyterlab packages. However, now that I’ve created this environment, whenever I try to create a new interactive session on Discovery with the custom conda environment, the Jupyter Notebook does not open. I do not get the “connect to jupyter” button, nor does it state “running” – it immediately goes to “completed”.
[A screenshot of a computer  Description automatically generated]

I would like to use this environment, so could you help me figure out where I went wrong with creating my environment?

Sincerely, Eline

-Eline

Cooke :
Hello Eline,

I am just reaching out to see if you had a chance to try and build the environment with the new method I suggested.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Eline,

Sorry for the difficulties on the environment being built. I just exported my environment that runs the code to a .yml file that you can build the same environment that I have.

I have attached the environment.yml file that will generate the same environment that I have in my space. If you could copy that file to your /home directory and run the following commands:

srun --pty /bin/bash
module load anaconda3/2022.05
conda env create -n pyspi_new --file  environment.yml 
source pyspi_new
cd pyspi/
pip install .

This will build the environment and application and if you could test this build and see if the code runs. Sorry again for the delay in getting this setup.

Thank you,

Joseph

Bouwmeesters :
reply from: bouwmeesters.e@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

I tried your provided commands this morning to create the environment “pyspi2”.
Firstly I got the error that Numba requires NumPy version of 1.25 or higher. So I updated Numpy.

However, now I get the following:
[cid:image002.png@01D9F075.F37CE9F0]

[cid:image003.png@01D9F075.F37CE9F0]

Which indicates that a wrong version of Numpy is used/expected. However, the installation satisfies all requirements (I think). So then I tried to update tslearn (that was the package that threw this error) but conda gives the warning that “the environment is inconsistent”, which is probably caused my mixing pip and conda.

Soo in total, it unfortunately still does not work for me…

-Eline

Cooke :
Hello Eline,

I am just reaching out to see if you have a chance to try the additional python packages to see if that helped run the job successfully.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Eline,

I got the code to run successfully but I had to add a couple more packages to the conda environment. The following commands I ran after:

srun --pty /bin/bash
module load anaconda3/2022.05
source activate pyspi
conda install -c conda-forge openjdk -y
conda install pandas -y
conda install numpy -y
conda install scipy -y

If you could add the following packages in and see if that works in your environment. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Eline,

I just tried out the lines you sent and I got the following error message. 

JVMNotFoundException: No JVM shared library file (libjvm.so) found. Try setting up the JAVA_HOME environment variable properly.

It is looking like it is missing a Java module. Let me try and correct this and I will let you know the following steps.

Thank you,

Joseph

Bouwmeesters :
reply from: bouwmeesters.e@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

Thank you for trying it out! Could you also try the following lines after importing pyspi, because that’s where I got the error messages:


import numpy as np

import random



random.seed(42)



M = 5 # 5 processes

T = 100 # 100 observations



dataset = np.random.randn(M,T)

from pyspi.calculator import Calculator

calc = Calculator(dataset=dataset)

calc.compute()


I’ll try the commands to set up the environment 😊

-Eline

Cooke :
Hello Eline,

Thank you for the update. I did the following to get an environment built with both Octave and pyspi. When I loaded the JupyterLab Notebook, I was able to do the following:

import pyspi

without receiving an error message. Could you let me know a command to test to see if things are working as expected? 

How I built the environment:

srun --pty /bin/bash
module load anaconda3/2022.05
conda create -n pyspi python=3.9 -y
source activate pyspi
conda install jupyterlab -y
conda install -c conda-forge octave -y
git clone https://github.com/olivercliff/pyspi.git
cd pyspi/
pip install .

Thank you,

Joseph

Bouwmeesters :
reply from: bouwmeesters.e@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

Yeah I was finally able to install a version of Octave in a new conda environment called “test_env”, however am still running into trouble. I first installed octave, but then the required packages of pyspi (the package that I want to install, for which I am trying to install Octave) then clash with the other packages that octave also required.
Could you maybe look into how to get the package of pyspi working on the cluster? I’ve been trying to get it working for the past weeks ☹

-Eline

Cooke :
Hello Eline,

Thank you for updating me. Let me look into installing octave within conda. I will update the ticket when I work through those steps.

Thank you,

Joseph

Bouwmeesters :
reply from: bouwmeesters.e@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

With the proposed code, I was able to open a jupyter notebook and install pyspi but unfortunately it still does not work properly. The pyspi package requires Octave to be installed, however when I try to do that with “conda install -c conda-forge octave”  it doesn’t work… Do you know how I should install Octave in my environment? The environment is called pyspi.

-Eline

Cooke :
Hello Eline,

I am just reaching out to see if you were able to test the conda build for your environment and if everything is working.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Eline,

You are welcome! Just let me know when you have a chance to try it out and if it is working. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Bouwmeesters :
reply from: bouwmeesters.e@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

Thank you for your response! I don’t have any sessions open anymore, but I’ll try to create a new environment with the commands you provided. I’ll let you know if I run into trouble again.

-Eline

Cooke :
Hello Eline,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing and sorry about the late response to your inquiry.

I just tried to create the environment with the following steps:

srun --pty /bin/bash
module load anaconda3/2022.05
conda create -n pyspi_2 python=3.9 -y
source activate pyspi_2
conda install jupyterlab -y
git clone https://github.com/olivercliff/pyspi.git
cd pyspi/
pip install .

then in Open OnDemand I was able to access it with selecting the anaconda3/2022.05 and entering pyspi_2 as the custom conda environment.

Do you have some session IDs from Open OnDemand that I can pull the log files from to see if there is something that might be preventing it from launching? 

Thank you,

Joseph

Hi Matteo,

Thanks for reaching out to Research Computing.
We already have OpenBabel installed on Discovery. You can use the following command to load the module when you log in:

$ module load openbabel/2.4.1

After loading the module, you'll be able to execute OpenBabel commands.

Please inform me if you require the installation of a different version.

Thanks,

Description : Hello!

I am developing a web app for one of the labs I'm currently co-oping for and I am developing a backend that needs to be hosted somewhere. I have a Discover Cluster account and have access to the lab's directory "/work/cnelab". Would it be feasible to host a server for the lab's research on the cluster itself? If not that, do you have any other recommendations? I have all the code written for it; I just need an area where it can run for the duration of our study. I have attached my PI, Timothy Morris, to this conversation as well. If you need more information about the code, what the server is doing, or anything else, let me know and I would be happy to answer.

Hi Skye, 

I never heard back from you. So I am closing this ticket. Please open a new one if you still need assitance.

Caplins :
Hi Skye, 

What kind of app? If it's compatible with the OOD apps you can set it up in your ondemand/dev directory and if not we are happy to discuss other options. 

Will multiple people need to have access to it or just yourself?

Cheers,

Hello Dongwook,

Thank you for contacting RC with your query. Can you provide me some more information on which part is failing and the steps that led to the failure.
Did you try the installation on a conda environment? if not I would recommend creating a conda environment and installing opencv on it.

Hi Mariana,

I hope that you are doing well. A graduate student of mine Jiefu (Jeff) Tian is having difficulties installing an open access phase-field simulation package on discovery.

"Last time I attempted to install it on Discovery, I encountered an issue with the installation of 'dealii', an essential package that PRISMS is based on. I couldn't find a solution at that time. However, I am open to trying to install it again if we are interested in testing its maximum performance."

I was hoping that you could help him see if we can PRISM on discovery. We are interested in carrying benchmark comparisons of this package and our own GPU codes.

Thanks,

Subject: Re: LAMMPS


Hi Mingwang, I just updated ticket TASK0520433 but I noticed Manasvita close it.

Here it is again in case you can’t access it via the ticket:


I've copied over a directory:

/home/zhong.m/lammps-installation-files

It has the installation scripts + instructopns.



I've upgraded the Installation of LAMMPS by including FFTW based on MKL (which is a faster math kernal), as well as installing with a new OpenMPI library "openmpi/4.1.1-gcc6.4-cuda11.1" compiled with gcc 6.4 and supports InfiniBand communication (which I suspect the Spack install did not do), and CUDA11.1 support. I've also included architecture-based instruction optimization flags that will boost performance (-O3 -march=skylake-avx512).


Please review the instructions provided in the "notes" file which should explain the steps. But here are the main things:

1. The script "env_lammps_ani.sh" defines the full shell runtime environment of LAMMPS and all its dependencies. It needs to be located at the same directory as the install scripts: install_ani.sh , install_lammps.sh

2. I've set the installation path variable "SOFTWARE_DIR" to point to some new directory in your $HOME (/home/zhong.m/software/lammps) but you're free to change it as you like.

3. I've pointed to the ANI directory "ANI_DIR=/work/karmalab/mingwang/lammps/ani"  (which will be used only in script "install_ani.sh").

4. The script "install_lammps.sh " run successfully for me on my local directory and installed the binaries, libraries and headers in "SOFTWARE_INSTALL_PATH" (also can be modified before installation in env_lammps_ani.sh).

5. The script "install_ani.sh" failed with undefined reference errors to neurochem functions.
For example:
" undefined reference to `neurochem::cleanup_ani()' "

I'm suspecting that the libraries in '/work/karmalab/mingwang/lammps/ani/ani_binaries/lib_ani' have to be re-built to match the current setup.
For example checking which libraries they're linked against:

$ ldd libcppNeuroChem.so

 linux-vdso.so.1 =>  (0x00007ffd90f44000)
 libcublas.so.10 => not found

It looks like it was compiled before with CUDA 10 or 10.1 (libcublas, libcudart etc.)? However, the file README_ANI_BINARIES.txt specifies that it fits CUDA 11.1 ?



Can you share how those libraries were built or re-build them using the current environment script?


Thanks,

Hi Prof. Karma and Mingwang,



Apologies if this took longer than expected. There was a bug in the package manager ‘Spack’ in its latest release and we advised on how to manually resolve it.

Mingwang – thanks for the update and I’m glad it got installed finally. I’ll be happy to help with installation of any other packages you’ll need.

Good to know that the Docker container solution worked out for you and that you were able to install the corresponding Singularity container on Discovery. I'll go ahead and close this ticket now. Feel free to reach out as in when required.

Hi Joshi,

I have installed the PRISMS-PF myself using Singularity. There should be no further issues regarding this installation. You can close the case now. Thank you for informing me about the container on Discovery.

Hello Jiefu,

I have added you to the ticket so you will be getting updates as well. 

I will go over some steps on using Singularity and if you have any other follow up questions please let me know and we can work through them.

We have a few different modules of Singularity on Discovery to use and you can use them from an interactive srun session or from an sbatch session. To pull the container to Discovery we can use the `singularity pull` command as follows:

Move to a directory that you would like to store the container or you can move it after you pull it.

srun -N 1 -n 1 --pty /bin/bash
module load singularity/3.5.3
singularity pull prismspf.sif docker://stvdwtt/prismspf:latest

which will generate a .sif file in the directory you ran this command which is the Singularity image. 

To run Singularity in an interactive session you can use the following command:

singularity exec /path/to/prismspf.sif <command to run>

It might be helpful to run the command to get into the container to see what commands are available and what programs you have available inside the container from the developer:

singularity exec /path/to/prismspf.sif /bin/bash

and when you are done you can run `exit` to leave the container. 

You can use the -B flag in the singularity command to bind directories so you can have access to your data/input scripts and for a location to save the data to. An example of using this would be:

singularity exec -B "/scratch:/scratch,/work:/work" /path/to/prismspf.sif <command to run>

which would bind the /scratch and /work (the ones you have access to) to the respective directories inside the container. 

We also have a training session on containers and Singularity in our RC Training Canvas site which you can access from (https://northeastern.instructure.com/enroll/LNNCHN).

Thank you,

Joseph

Hi Joesph,

I have not tried the docker container on Discovery. I encountered difficulties when trying to install dealii using Spack or building it from scratch. I was unaware that I could utilize a container with Singularity on Discovery; this should save me a substantial amount of effort installing it. Could you provide more information on how to use sigularity on Discovery? I only have experience using docker container on my own laptop.

Could you add me into this incident as well? My account is under email tian.jie@northeastern.edu.

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Alain,

Seems to me that I misunderstood this to be a LAMMPS issue. For PRISM, has the student tried to use its Docker container? See

https://prisms-center.github.io/phaseField/doxygen_files/install_prereqs.html

We can work with Docker and have that imported to Discovery using Singularity instead of trying to install this from scratch on Discovery. Let me know what would you and your student would be most interested in doing and we can proceed from there.

Hi Alain,

Thanks for reaching out to RC regarding this and apologies for a tardy response. 

Could you give us more details on the issues your student is facing on installing Deal.II in LAMMPS? Has LAMMPS been already built from scratch on Discovery and your student is having difficulties adding the PRISM package to it or did they use Spack to get the LAMMPS installation going? We do have lammps modules also available on Discovery and I wanted to know if your student got a chance to upload that and then see if it works in terms of adding the PRISM package?

If it's better for you and your student, then they can also book a consultation with us using https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/

Hi Serena,

It’s a pleasure to (virtually) meet you!

Unfortunately, I am unable to access the list you attached.  It doesn’t appear in my email, and I’m unable to trace the incident report without a NEU login.  (Jing-Ke has approved my account, but unfortunately I seem to be unable to claim it.  Maybe there was a problem with the info that was put in?  Who should I talk to about this?)

We’ve been chatting a bit with Greg and Joseph about managing long-running and/or high memory programs.  For instance, when I run Trinity on a new amphibian genome, it usually runs for about a month with 20 CPUs, and I sometimes need a 400GB node.  My understanding is that Trinity can restart from the latest completed step, but it's still far over 5 days between checkpoints.  Do you have any advice about how we could do that at NEU?  

Many thanks,
Kate

Caplins :
Hi Kate (et al), 

I first wanted to do a brief introduction. I'm the Associate Bioinformatician on staff at Research Computing and I am excited to help you transition over to Discovery. 

Thank you for the detailed list of programs. I've gone through and listed whether the program is currently available as a module on Discovery, and if not, whether it can be installed locally with conda or other means. I've attached a spreadsheet here with that information for each program. Fortunately, it looks like we have nearly half of the programs as modules, and most of the others are available in conda or through a local installation in your /work directory.  If there are any programs that are not available as modules but you would prefer them to be accessible in that way (or you run into difficulties in installing the program locally) please fill out a software installation request form here: https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=777c510bdbebd340a37cd206ca9619b0

There is one program that we will need to install on the cluster for you, Juicer. We can get that going while you get set up with data transfer. And on that note, I see the message from Wallace below and will pass that on to the team. 

Please let me know if there's anything else I can help you with.

Cheers, 
Serena

Hi Moritz,

Thanks for reaching out to RC with your request.

I've granted you access to the Discovery cluster.
Your User ID is laber.m and your password is the same as your Northeastern password.
Try to login Discovery after 2-3 hours (changes aren't applied right away), using following one of the connection methods in the documentation:

1. Using SSH (through a terminal):
Mac: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/first_steps/connect_mac.html
Windows: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/first_steps/connect_windows.html
2. Using our web portal Open OnDemand (OOD) (without the need of a Linux terminal):
https://ood.discovery.neu.edu/
OOD Login instructions: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/first_steps/connect_ood.html
You can read more about OOD here:

Description : Hello,
                I am currently trying to do some work for my BINF6310 course and I received this error when trying to login to a computing node.

srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: User's group not permitted to use this partition

Please let me know how to fix this. Thanks so much for your help!

Best,
-Ethan Littlestone

Shomo :
hello ethan-

you should be all set now (your particular section was
not registered to use the cluster until this week). we are
undergoing system-maintenance today, though, so it will
be a few more hours before the cluster is available for use.

thank you 
&& happy computing !
[greg]

Littlestone :
Any updates so far?

Littlestone :
thank you greg

Shomo :
hello oyeronke-

we are trying to figure out why ethan is not showing up
as a student in the canvas listing for BINF6310.20955.202410.

do you have some time to do a screen-share so we can
figure this  out ? 

thank you !
[greg]

Littlestone :
That is my exact input and error received when I am on my terminal

Littlestone :
[littlestone.e@login-00 ~]$ cd /courses/BINF6310.202410
-bash: cd: /courses/BINF6310.202410: Permission denied

Littlestone :
Hello Greg, on my student hub under BINF6310 it says section 07, but on canvas the number is 20955

Shomo :
hello ethan-

who is the teacher for your section ? sorry, the section numbers
i have from canvas range from 20952 to 20964. 

thank you i
[greg]

Littlestone :
And Girish I am in my terminal and have successfully connected to Discovery and in a login node, I figured out how to get into a computing node but I cannot perform the tasks i need because I do not have permission for my course directory

Littlestone :
I am in section 07 of BINF6310

Shomo :
hello ethan-

apologies for the delay, but your account is not showing
up in our canvas query for the course. which section are you 
in ? that should help us to track this down.

thank you !
[greg]

Shomo :
user does not appear to be in the canvas output for any course (updated the course-plan at 0530 EDT today (tuesday))

Pillai :
Are you trying to access the directory using ood or shell?

Littlestone :
I have reached out to my instructor letting them know of this issue but I have not received a response yet.

Littlestone :
I cannot access my course directory and am receiving a permission denied error. My code is "cd /courses/BINF6310.202410" and I am receiving a permission denied error.

Pillai :
Hi Ethan,

Thanks for reaching out to Research Computing.
Could you also please send the command that you are using to request the resource.

Thanks,
Girish Pillai

Description : I am trying to use internet to push the local changes in the repo on discovery using the vscode server but no luck. Tried loading and unloading discovery module but that doesn't work.  Some errors: ```> git pull --tags origin mp_thermal_decay

Caplins :
Hi Maharshi, 

I haven't heard from you in a while so I am closing this ticket. Please reach out again if you need anything. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Caplins :
Hi Maharshi,

Have you been able to access github through discovery now?

Just checking that this is still an issue. You can check that you have the discovery module loaded with this command: module list
If the discovery module was unloaded (possibly via the command module purge) you will lose the ability to connect to the internet. The discovery module sets the HTTP proxy needed to access the internet from nodes. You can get it back by logging out and then back in. Or by reloading it via: module load discovery/2019-02-21

Hope that helps, 

Serena

Caplins :
Hi Maharshi, 

Is this still not working for you? I checked the github repo listed above and couldn't find one that matched the name whole_energy_homes_analysis in the NEU-ABLE-LAB do you mind checking that the name is correct or the repo is still there?

We do occasionally have connectivity issues but everything seems to be okay at the moment (I have been using git off and on all day on discovery). 

Cheers, 
Serena

Description : Hi,

I am trying to install the package 'dada2' (https://benjjneb.github.io/dada2/dada-installation.html) into the R interactive app on open on demand but I keep running into this error (see below). I thought the issue might be that I didn't have zlib installed so I went ahead and installed that. However, I'm still getting the same error. Would you be able to help me with this?

Thank you!

Hi Johanna, 

Thank you for meeting with me in our consultation yesterday. I wanted to let you know that I tested installing 'dada2' in the OOD app version 4.2.1 with the geospatial flavor, and it worked! 

So that is another option and probably a more straightforward one (Sorry I didn't test that option first!). We recommend using packrat on the cluster to manager package installations so I would get that set up if you haven't already.  Here's some documentation on setting that up. https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/r.html

Thank you for all your help!

Caplins :
Also note that the environment_R.yml file will need to be edited to reflect your environment path. For example, /work/groupname/username

You can also change the name of the conda environment in the .yml file. 

Either or both of these can be achieved with a text editor of your choosing: vi, vim, nanos, etc

Caplins :
Hi Johanna, 

Thank you for your patience as I worked on this. I found a solution and was able to create a conda environment with base R and RStudio and several other required packages. I then installed BiocManager and dada2 in R via the command line. To use this environment interactively I opened an Xfce4 session on the Open OnDemand app and after activating my conda environment launched rstudio from the terminal. 

I have included detailed instructions dada2_conda.html file here (you can open in any browser, though chrome is best). As well as the environment_R.yml file which I used to create the conda environment. 

Please let me know if you have any questions. Also feel free to set up a consultation is you would like to go over getting this all set up together. 

Have a good weekend!

Hi Johanna, 

Thank you for your patience as I work on this. I have a possible solution. I am able to install dada2 in RStudio in a conda environment and then launch RStudio as an interactive app in a way similar to the OOD apps. I have run into some issues with some versions of base R that I need to troubleshoot. But I wanted to check in with you in regards to your timeline. Are you okay waiting a few more days or even the end of this week as I test different versions?

Alternatively, I could get you a solution today or tomorrow that you can test, but it will be a little longer to have a fully stable version that is released to all the users. What would you prefer?

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi LI,

 To install SaMOS with VTK support. I understand that VTK has an extensive set of capabilities, and I'd like to make sure that we're tailoring the build process to your needs.

One key aspect of VTK is its ability to render and visualize data, which often requires OpenGL or Mesa3D support. However, if you're not planning to use these visualization capabilities and you're primarily interested in VTK's input/output (IO) modules (for reading and writing VTK files), it is possible to build VTK without requiring OpenGL or Mesa3D.

Therefore, before proceeding further, could you please confirm if you need to perform 3D rendering or visualization with VTK, or if you only need the IO modules of VTK?

Your response will help us to customize the installation process for you more effectively.

Prasanth

 No worries and thanks for the help. I implemented your suggestions but I’m still getting an “out of memory” error. Before I do the teams meeting, I want to go through the datasets at my end to check if there’s no problem with the data that we are running because other larger datasets ran fine with this code. I’ll get back to you once we are sure on that end.

Thanks,

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hello Priyanka,

I apologize for the delayed response.

Upon reviewing your job submissions, it's apparent that you're requesting 100GB of memory and almost 85% of it is being utilized. You can also check the memory usage to assess if the requested amount was insufficient or if the usage was more than anticipated, using the 'seff' command. Here is an example:

`seff 37780503`

The job ID is displayed in the title (e.g., MATLAB (37780503)) when you launch the MATLAB application through OOD.

Despite your utilization of around 85%, you're encountering an "out of memory" issue. As a precautionary measure, we recommend increasing the requested memory to 128GB and trying again. This will ensure we have sufficient memory if the computations require more resources.

Also, if you're working with large datasets, consider using the 'clear' command to release memory resources once the specific variables are no longer needed.

In response to your request for a Teams meeting, please feel free to schedule a one-on-one consultation with our RC staff at: https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/

Do not hesitate to get back to us if you need any further assistance.

Hi,

I have cleared my home directory and moved most files on the storage cluster. I can launch MATLAB now through OOD but when I run my analysis, MATLAB throws the error “out of memory”. I have dealt with equally heavy files in the past and they ran smoothly in the cluster. I also tried increasing the JAVA heap memory in Matlab preferences but that too didn’t work. I wonder what is causing the problem. Thanks for sharing the couple of steps in your mail but I do not come from a hard core computer background, so couldn’t try most of those things. I would prefer doing a zoom call to implement them (if you still think that is the solution). Thank you.

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hello Priyanka,

It appears that you've encountered the "Disk quota exceeded" error because you've surpassed the allocated disk quota of 75GB in your /home directory. Your current usage stands at 135GB, which exceeds the given limit. For more insight on storage limits, you can visit our resource documentation here: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/storage/discovery_storage.html

To resolve this, I recommend taking the following steps to clean up your /home:


1. Move runs to /scratch and important data should be backed up to /work
if your PI doesn’t have space in /work :
New Storage Space request: https://bit.ly/NURC-NewStorage

If you dont have a PI you can temporarily store your data at /scratch but keep in mind that this folder will be purged regularly and avoid keeping important data

2. Clean the ~/ondemand logs directory occasionally 
3. Clear the ~/.conda directory: 
    1. Clean unused packages and caches: 
    `source activate <your environment>
    conda clean --all`
    This will not delete unused packages located in, say /shared/centos7/anaconda3/2021.11/pkgs
    but will remove packages in your local ~/.conda/pkgs folder.
    2. Clean unused conda environments:
    `conda env list`
    `conda env remove --name <name>
    OR
    conda env remove --prefix=<absolute-path-to-the-environment>`
    3. If you plan to create new conda environments in the future, the best would be use it with the `--prefix` command and install it in a permanent group storage share (under /work). For example:
    `conda create myenv --prefix=/work/<mygroup>/<mydirectory>`
    https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/create.html
4. Perform regular `du -sh *` 
    
    To figure out directory usage:
    
    1. Go to a compute node.
    
    2. Run: `du -shc /<directory>/*`
    
    3. du -h --max-depth=1 `/<directory>`
    
5. Clean `~/.cache` (make sure no processes are using it currently). 
6. Additional possible culprit is the `~/.singularity` directory which stores a copy of all pulled images: `singularity cache clean all`

Feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions

Description : Hello,

I hope this email finds you well.

I just started using Cluster and there is an issue that prevents me from running my notebook in JupyterLab. I'm using Cluster to work on a machine learning project and I need to import the following modules:
import ee
import tensorflow
However, even if I installed the two packages and I could see them lie in my pip list, I still got "No module named 'ee'/'tensorflow'". I tried re-running pip install and restarting my kernel to import, or deleting the instance and created a new one, but the problem persists.

I'm using a custom conda environment TF_env with all necessary packages installed.

Could you help me with this problem? Thank you!

Hi Mia,
Appreciate your patience.

At the moment, we don't have a method to directly access data from third-party cloud platforms. If the data size is manageable (a few gigabytes), I suggest downloading it to your "/work" or "/scratch" directory in Discovery. This way, you can access the file in OOD.

We're actively exploring options to potentially support third-party cloud platforms in the future.

Feel free to reach out if you have any more questions.

Regards,
Girish Pillai

m.joshi (Work notes) :
@Pillai, Girish, your solution is correct. Often times users forget to install jupyterlab in their TF_env environment. Also, I've seen that installing jupyterlab prior to TF works than the other way round. 
Ask the user to check their .bashrc as well. Is they have the conda init statement or a module load anaconda command, then that might lead the python version getting pulled from there instead of the TF_env.

Hi Mia,

I'm not sure if there's a way to move data from Google Cloud to Discovery, but I'll check and get back to you if three's any solution to it.

Pillai :
Hi Mia,

Hope you're doing well.
Appreciate your patience.

I attempted to replicate the environment, and it seems the issue is that to access the package on OOD, you also need to install Jupyter Lab within that environment.
To resolve this, you can activate your custom environment in the terminal and proceed to install Jupyter Lab using the below command

##############################################
conda install -c conda-forge jupyterlab
##############################################

After installing Jupyter Lab, please go to OOD, and before requesting the Jupyter notebook, make sure to restart your web server once.

Hi Yanting,

Thanks for reaching out to Research Computing.

After connecting to the Jupyter notebook, did you check to see which environment is currently set as your working environment? It's possible that you've installed the package in your virtual environment, but Jupyter may still be referencing the base environment where the package is not installed.

You can use the below code to check the active environment in your notebook cell:
#######################################
import sys
!conda info --envs
print("Active Conda Environment:", sys.executable)
#######################################

Thanks for the quick reply. This is what it looks like on my end? I’m not sure how to determine if she was given the same username. Let me know if I can provide further information. -Steven

hello sijin-

thank you for reaching out to RC !

did your sponsored account get the same username 
as you had earlier ? i ask because i do not see you in 
ldap or in krb5 (ie, active-directory). here's a recent
entry from the logs

Aug 13 04:50:18 login-01 sshd[241410]: pam_krb5[241410]: authentication fails for 's.ren' (s.ren@NUNET.NEU.EDU): \ 
User not known to the underlying authentication module (Client not found in Kerberos database)

@Lopez, Steven can you verify the sponsored account
is still active ? 

let us know how that goes && i'll try reaching out to some 
folks in IAM also.

Description : Hello,

  I am getting an error while uploading my dataset files from my local system to the discovery cluster on my home account. Any help regarding how to resolve this issue will be appreciated.

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hello Priyanka,

It appears that you've encountered the "Disk quota exceeded" error because you've surpassed the allocated disk quota of 75GB in your /home directory. Your current usage stands at 135GB, which exceeds the given limit. For more insight on storage limits, you can visit our resource documentation here: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/storage/discovery_storage.html

To resolve this, I recommend taking the following steps to clean up your /home:


1. Move runs to /scratch and important data should be backed up to /work
if your PI doesn’t have space in /work :
New Storage Space request: https://bit.ly/NURC-NewStorage

If you dont have a PI you can temporarily store your data at /scratch but keep in mind that this folder will be purged regularly and avoid keeping important data

2. Clean the ~/ondemand logs directory occasionally 
3. Clear the ~/.conda directory: 
    1. Clean unused packages and caches: 
    `source activate <your environment>
    conda clean --all`
    This will not delete unused packages located in, say /shared/centos7/anaconda3/2021.11/pkgs
    but will remove packages in your local ~/.conda/pkgs folder.
    2. Clean unused conda environments:
    `conda env list`
    `conda env remove --name <name>
    OR
    conda env remove --prefix=<absolute-path-to-the-environment>`
    3. If you plan to create new conda environments in the future, the best would be use it with the `--prefix` command and install it in a permanent group storage share (under /work). For example:
    `conda create myenv --prefix=/work/<mygroup>/<mydirectory>`
    https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/commands/create.html
4. Perform regular `du -sh *` 
    
    To figure out directory usage:
    
    1. Go to a compute node.
    
    2. Run: `du -shc /<directory>/*`
    
    3. du -h --max-depth=1 `/<directory>`
    
5. Clean `~/.cache` (make sure no processes are using it currently). 
6. Additional possible culprit is the `~/.singularity` directory which stores a copy of all pulled images: `singularity cache clean all`

Feel free to reach out to us if you have any questions

Sure!
So after I login to my OOD account, I go to Files>home directory /home/p.ghosh; then upon clicking the blue upload icon, I choose browse folders which takes me to folders on my local system; after selecting the desired folder and hitting upload, the files start uploading but then throw an error in upload message shortly. I also just saw another issue where I can’t run any job on my cluster, where I get the following error while trying to launch MATLAB.

Failed to stage the template with the following error:

Hello Priyanka,

I understand that you're having trouble uploading your datasets to the cluster. Could you provide a bit more information about the steps you've been following to upload the files and the specific error message you've been encountering? This information will help us troubleshoot your issue.

In the meantime, our documentation on transferring files may provide some helpful guidance: <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html>

Description : Good afternoon, 

I was recently trying to resolve a package conflict, but now believe that I have also created an error with packrat. 

1. When I initialize my packrat using packrat::init("FOLDERNAME IN WORK_ENCRYPTED") it attempts to restart the R session, but then cannot complete, giving this message.  Even with that, if I navigate to the working directory, it navigates to the correct working directory specified below, but I still have to call my packages via library: 

Initializing packrat project in directory:
- "/work_encrypted/crookes/Shared/Sanctuary Policies/Code/Danielle/packrat"
Initialization complete!

Restarting R session...

Packrat is not installed in the local library -- attempting to bootstrap an installation...
> No source tarball of packrat available locally
> Using user-library packrat (0.9.1) to bootstrap this project
Initializing packrat project in directory:
- "/home/d.crookes"
Packrat mode off. Resetting library paths to:
- "/home/d.crookes/R/x86_64-pc-linux-gnu-library/4.2"
- "/usr/local/lib/R/site-library"
- "/usr/local/lib/R/library"

I'm still a new R user, so this may be an easy fix, but I could use some assistance.  

2. Once my packrat initialization is restored, then I could also use assistance with my packages.  When I try to load "gtsummary", I get the following message:
> library (gtsummary)
Error: package or namespace load failed for ‘gtsummary’ in loadNamespace(j <- i[[1L]], c(lib.loc, .libPaths()), versionCheck = vI[[j]]):
 namespace ‘cli’ 3.3.0 is already loaded, but >= 3.4.0 is required

But when I install "cli" and call cli, I get this error:

Although these errors point to my home directory, these same errors were present when I knew my packrat was working. 

Thank you!
Danielle

Crookes :
Thanks again for the call today. As promised, here is the list of packages that I had installed and were trying to use in the Rstudio tidyverse flavor. I also tried to correct the "cli" package to resolve the conflict, but that's the one that wouldn't unload even though it installed.   I don't need additional help at this time, so it's ok to close the ticket now.  Thanks!

#install.packages("readxl")

#install.packages("sandwich")
#install.packages("gt")
#install.packages("dplyr")
#install.packages("readr")
#install.packages("gtsummary")

Crookes :
Thanks you.  Teams at 2:30 is fine.

Caplins :
Hi Danielle, 

Let's do 2:30 tomorrow. I'll call you in teams unless you prefer zoom? If zoom I can send a link. 

Talk to you soon. 
Serena

Crookes :
Yes, let's book a consultation together.  I"m available until 4:30 today or can do 11:15-4:15 tomorrow 7/27/23. Thank you.

Caplins :
Hi Danielle, 

Can you try running these commands in the following order:

packrat::init('/work/pathtopackratlocation')
packrat::on()

From here proceed with package installation. It seems packrat is initialized but then turned off. 

If that doesn't help, you can book a consultation with me and we can try and fix the issues together, or I am happy to answer your messages here (particularly if your directory paths are sensitive). 

Cheers, 
Serena

By the way. Do I need to have the person who approved my sponsored account approve the account request for computing access?

Aideyan :
Thank you for your help today, Surya. Yes, what you summarized is correct. I think the first option you listed is what will work best. If I can transfer the data that I am analyzing to the discovery cluster and run my analyses there, I think that will be easiest.

Periaswamy :
Hello Babatunde,


Thank you for scheduling a consultation with me. Here is a brief summary of our discussion today:


You wanted to run Jupter lab locally while using the processing power of the discovery cluster.

Once you have an account setup, We can go through the process of running Jupyter Lab on the discovery cluster. There are two routes that we can take
https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-ood/introduction.html :
 the second option would be to have Jupyter Lab running the cluster and use an SSH tunnel to view the results on your local machine.

Description : Hi,

I'm trying to setup and run the batchtools library 
(https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/batchtools/index.html) in R 
which I access through this singularity image 
"/shared/container_repository/rstudio/rocker-geospatial-4.2.1.sif". 
Unfortunately when using R through the singularity image I am unable to 
use command like "squeue" and "sbatch" which batchtools relys on to 
submit jobs. When I call batchtools from R not found in a singularity 
image it works as expected.

When I run:

"

RSTUDIO_IMAGE="/shared/container_repository/rstudio/rocker-geospatial-4.2.1.sif"

singularity shell --bind /work,/scratch,/tmp ${RSTUDIO_IMAGE}

squeue

"

I get the error: "bash: squeue: command not found"


However when I run:

"

RSTUDIO_IMAGE="/shared/container_repository/rstudio/rocker-geospatial-4.2.1.sif"

internal_path=$(singularity exec ${RSTUDIO_IMAGE} bash -c "echo \$PATH")
export SINGULARITYENV_PATH=/usr/bin2:${PATH}:$internal_path
export USER=$USER
singularity shell --bind 
"/var/log/munge,/var/run/munge,/usr/bin:/usr/bin2,/etc/slurm,/usr/lib64/slurm,/home,/scratch,/work" 
-login ${RSTUDIO_IMAGE}

squeue

"

I instead get the error:

"squeue: error: Invalid user for SlurmUser slurm, ignored
squeue: fatal: Unable to process configuration file
"

Do you have any advice on what I need to do to be able to submit jobs to 
the scheduler from inside the singularity image?

Thanks!

Hi Jason, 

Thank you for reaching out to RC. Yes slurm isn't installed in the rocker containers, so even by binding the slurm paths to the container it will still be missing the actual slurm program. 

There are several options that you could try: 
1. install R in a conda environment and then install batchtools.
2. Try another container. We happen to have a container that we built with R and slurm installed. It was built as a desktop app for the OOD. Of course we haven't tested to do the things you're attempting but you're welcome to try it. 
3. Use one of the available R modules on discovery. 
4. Build a new container (perhaps if a test of number 2 looks promising). 

I'm also happy to try some of these out for you if you're interested. 

If it were me. I would just use slurm array with a dataframe in R that specify the parameters I want to test in each array. But of course that all depends on what you're trying to do. 

Hope that helps!
Cheers, 
Serena

Hello Vladimir,

Thanks for reaching out to RC. We're pleased to inform you that we have installed the updated version 3.6.8 of Weka and it is now accessible as a module. To load the application, you can use the command: 
module load weka/weka-3-8-6.

Additionally, we're in the process of integrating this version of Weka into OOD. We'll make sure to notify you as soon as it's completed.

That's great. Thanks much @DWADASI, PRASANTH! 

The last time I had built WEKA, it was just a tarball that needed to be downloaded, untarred, to get the executable, and made into a module before adding to the OOD app. You can see at /shared/centos7/weka/

p.dwadasi (Work notes) :
Sure @Joshi, Manasvita,  i will work on this

m.joshi (Work notes) :
@DWADASI, PRASANTH, would you have the bandwidth to download the latest version of this software and add that as a module?

https://waikato.github.io/weka-wiki/downloading_weka/
OR
https://sourceforge.net/projects/weka/

The latest version of the module will have to be added to the existing WEKA OOD app as well.

Hello Ankita,


Thank you for booking a consultation with me, here's a brief summary of our discussion.
You had trouble with opening RStudio on the cluster using open ondemand. Sometimes the applications take a couple of minutes but never loads and sometimes you received a 

"Status code 502 returned by Studio Server when executing 'client _init' " error.

We tried deleting the multiple instances of RStudio which you had opened up on the open ondemand portal, but that didn't seem to provide a solution.
We also tried to clean up the .RHistory and other hidden environment variables, but that also didn't prove to be useful.

I am going to go through this issue and debug the error. I will get back to you with updates regarding this.

Description : Dear Sir/Ma'am,

Thanks to your assistance, I have successfully been able to use OpenCV through Conda. 
However, I've noticed that the execution of pytesseract and OpenCV is quite slow. 
While the same operations on my laptop usually take between 10 to 30 seconds, on the provided setup, 
it takes more than 10 minutes. 
The installation process itself also took several days to complete.

Is there a way to optimize its performance?

For your reference, I am using the personal directory /home/lee.dongw/ inside discovery.new.edu.

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Dongwook,

Thanks for reaching out to RC regarding this. Apologies for a tardy response. 

As for slow performance of PyTessaract, could you share the script that you are using to launch the job? The type of node (c-node vs d-node) could make a difference here. All our d-nodes are newer and faster. So it might be worth running your program on those nodes and see if you get a speed-up. You can run on program on a d-node by using --constraint=ib flag in either your `srun` command or 'sbatch` script. 

Regarding the installation of OpenCV through conda, how did you do the installation? Sometimes having conda channel preferences in $HOME/.condarc can slow down the installation. But I noticed that there is no .condarc located in your $HOME, which is fine. So wanted to understand how the installation was carried out. 

It might be helpful to book a consultation with us to discuss this further and diagnose the issue quickly. You can do so by going to https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/

Description : Hello Aston,

Thank you for scheduling a consultation with me on August 9, 2023. Below is a summary for the topics that we discussed in the meeting:

1. You have 50 TB of data that you are migrating from your previous university on a NAS to Northeastern and in particular to Discovery.
2. I shared that as a PI you will receive 35 TB free and you will be charge per TB over 35 TB at the rate that Northeastern pays for it which for the new fiscal year is still being set but is looking to be about ~$160 per TB per year or a little more. I said I would get the final number for you so you will have more information about the price. 
3. I also shared that we have archival data storage (tape and disk) that if your data doesn't have to be accessible all the time on the HPC would be an option since they are less expensive. 
4. As far as moving the data, I shared our link to the data transfer page and said that we support Globus, command line programs (rsync, scp, etc) to copy data from your current directories over to Discovery. I said I was going to look more into Globus and the usage case for your data migration over to Discovery and Northeastern. 
5. I also shared that the node that you would use to move the data is 'xfer.discovery.neu.edu' which is the dedicated data transfer node. 
6. I shared the following link to submit to get a Discovery account (https://bit.ly/NURC-AccessRequest) and shared the following link to get setup with a /work storage space (https://bit.ly/NURC-NewStorage).
7. You shared that some of the data is identifiable data and I said that we do offer encryption at rest and we would have to follow up with the procedures to get that setup.

We can talk more about the data transfer and any other follow up questions that come up during this here.

Thank you,

Joseph

Hi Parth Bharatbhai, 

This looks like a network connection issue. Can you confirm that the discovery module is loaded by running the command in the terminal: 

module list

You should see something like this:
Currently Loaded Modulefiles:
  1) discovery/2021-10-06

If you don't see that please run this command: 

module load discovery/2021-10-06

And then try your instal again. 

Cheers, 
Serena

m.joshi (Work notes) :
make sure that the discovery module is loaded on the compute node using module list.

Description : Hi,

I’m having an issue when I’m running a vscode server.  I edit a file, save it, then run a sbatch and the actual file that’s being run doesn’t reflect the changes I just made.  Easiest to show on share screen.  

Thanks,

Cooke :
Hello Jonathan,

Did you get the slurm job array to work or do you have follow up questions on using slurm job arrays?

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Jonathan,

No worries on missing the first email. I just wanted to reach out and see if everything was okay.

You are correct, the the array jobs in slurm is a way to progressively and systematically launch other jobs or pass different arguments to the job itself. We have a few examples in this github (https://github.com/northeastern-rc/training-slurmarrayjobs) and we have a section in our documentation (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/slurm.html#example-using-job-array-flag). 

What are the steps you are trying to submit jobs by? If they are by integers you can use the $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID which maps to the sub job id. If they don't go by integers or there is a more complex walk you can always map the $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID to an array in bash which will pull and use those values.

Please let me know if you have additional questions but the slurm job arrays would probably be the best way to accomplish what you are trying to do.

Thank you,

Joseph

Sullivan :
reply from: sullivan.jona@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph -
I would start the sbatch job and then edit/save the file for the next job before slurm was able to allocate the resources and spin up the first job.  I’m tuning a machine learning algorithm and I test different parameters across a range of values one after another.  Is there a way to submit multiple jobs that all have slightly different changes to the source file?  Is this what sbatch —array is for? :

Thanks,

Jonathan

Cooke :
Hello Jonathan,

I am just checking to see if you want to schedule a consultation or if you were able to determine what was occurring with the sbatch file.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Jonathan,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing and sorry for the late response to your inquiry. 

Are you using VS Code locally when this is happening or are you using it on Open OnDemand? Also are you running sbatch through the terminal in VS Code or through another connection to Discovery? If you want to schedule a consultation with me and we can try and debug this in that session my bookings page is here (https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/). 

Thank you,

RITM Update: reply from: ma.ding@northeastern.edu

Hello Girish,

Thank you so much for adding me to the long partition.

I was wondering how many Slurm jobs I can submit when I stay in a long partition? Thanks.

Best,
Mao

Pillai :
Hello @Ding, Mao,
We've added you to long partition. 
This change will take effect within 2-3 hours, and you can start running jobs once you're able to see the "long" group when typing the command:

$ groups

To run jobs on the long partition, use the Slurm flag --partition=long.

Thanks,
Girish Pillai

Ding :
RITM Update: reply from: ma.ding@northeastern.edu

Hello Girish,

Thank you for the advice. I used mclapply() with mc.cores before, unfortunately, nothing improved. I ran the simulation before, but all the statistics methods could be finished very soon.

And recently I added a new statistic test method (mixR), it increased the running time significantly. So, I believe the biggest challenge is need a longer running time.

Best,
Mao

Pillai :
Also, I don't believe RAM is the primary concern in this situation. While the code isn't optimized to utilize greater RAM capacity effectively, requesting 2 terabytes of RAM would result in extended queuing time as it awaits resource allocation.

Pillai :
Hello @Ding, Mao,

I can see that you have used lapply()in your script. Have you tried replacing those with mclapply()?

Ding :
RITM Update: reply from: ma.ding@northeastern.edu

Hello Girish,

Yes. I've tried different settings. But none of them finished in 24 hours. For example, the execution of the job (ID 38565787_1) is with nodes = 2, and ntask = 100, Memory = 2T terminated due to time limits. And the requested resource sat in queue for more than one week to be available.

Best,
Mao

Pillai :
Hey @Ding, Mao,
Can you try using the parallel package and the function `mclapply()` wherever you are doing the actual calculation or aggregation.
I would also recommend you to keep the memory to 8GB or 16GB but try to use more  --ntasks and --cpus-per-task as to leverage parallel processing.

You can refer the following documentations to modify your code and test:
https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/parallel/versions/3.6.2/topics/detectCores
https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/parallel/versions/3.4.1/topics/mclapply

Pillai :
Hello @Ding, Mao,
I see that you have mentioned you ran it on 3 tasks on 1 node with RAM 512G.
Have you tried increasing the --ntasks and --cpus-per-task and were you able to see any improvements?
Is it possible to parallelize the code on multiple nodes.

Thanks,
Girish Pillai

Ding :
RITM Update: reply from: ma.ding@northeastern.edu

Correct.

Pillai :
Hey @Ding, Mao,
Thank you so much.
I can see 2 files "array_weib.sh" & "mixr_weib.R"
Is that correct?

Description : Hi,

I hope you're doing well!

I am reaching out on behalf of Dr. Alexandra Rodman, who is new faculty in the psychology department. We are aware that each faculty member is granted 35T of secure storage on the discovery cluster. What is the level of security on the discovery cluster? Would we, for example, be able to keep identifiable human subjects' data on the discovery cluster that would only be accessible to our lab/specific people in our lab?

If yes, what steps do we need to complete to get access to this secure storage?

Description : I am having an issue with the Gamess software (I am using the 2018 version installed on discovery as the others do not run properly). There is an error in the .out file that just states "TDDFT =" even when I am not running TDDFT. I wanted to check to see if the software has been properly installed. Also, if it is possible to get an updated version of the program (if 2021 is not the most recent version). The path I am running these jobs out of is as follows: "/scratch/adrion.d/mrsf-calcs/test"  and the command used to run the input file is `rungms [filename].inp` (the file is in this directory).
Let me know if you have any more questions or need any more information. Thanks

Cooke :
Hello Daniel,

Thank for testing out the GAMESS install and letting me know that you were able to successfully run a job after editing the job script. Also thank you for letting me know that everything seems to be working right. You are welcome for the assistance! 

I am going to resolve this ticket. If you have any other questions please reach out to Research Computing at the following links: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/welcome/gettinghelp.html

Thank you,

Joseph

Adrion :
Hi Joseph, it looks like the GAMESS install worked fine. I was able to successfully run a job after making edits to an input file for some of the different modules. I think everything is working right now, and I can reach out to RC if there are any more issues that come up. Thanks for the help!

Cooke :
Hello Daniel,

I am reaching out to see if you had the time to test the GAMESS install to see if it is working with scripts that you have used in the past? Also if you have any other questions that I can assist with.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Daniel,

I just finished up the installation of GAMESS 2020.1. If you want to test it out please use the --constraint=ib because it was compiled on the d nodes. You will have to 

module load gcc/10.1.0 
module load gamess/2020.1 

to have access to gamees and the compiler libraries it was built against.  Please let me know if you are able to run it on input files that you know run successfully. I tested it against the test suite the developer provides and it successfully ran and exited on the 47 test cases. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Daniel,

Sorry for the delayed response. We can install that version on Discovery. Please fill out this request (https://bit.ly/NURC-Software) so we can start working on installing it as a module. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Adrion :
Hi, it would be great if you could install that 2020 version of Gamess as a module that can be used. Just so it's more up to date. I can try with a new input on that one after it's installed, if that works. Thanks!

Cooke :
Hello Daniel,

You are welcome and no problem in testing it. I wanted to make sure it wasn't the build we used which is why I built a copy from scratch and checked it with the test files they provided. The 2020 currently isn't in a module form and I just built it in my scratch. If you want to have it as a module that is something we can do through the software installation ticket and we can build it there.

 The current versions seems to be September 2022 but when I was trying to download it yesterday, the website wasn't allowing me to submit the request.  That might be something to reach out to the developers and ask about because it seems they have a newer copy available. 

Also thank you for letting me know that you are going to write the input script out from scratch to check and see if there is an error in it. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Adrion :
Hi Joseph, thanks for testing this. I actually got the input file from someone else who had ran it on a different system and just tried running it outright. I guess that was the issue. I am going to try to just build a new input file from scratch and test that. For running the 2020 version of the program, which module/commands should I run to load everything? I was just using the 2018 build and just loading that module. Thanks!

Cooke :
Hello Daniel,

I just wanted to follow up and thank you for testing the script on your end as well. I did a fresh local install in my /scratch directory of GAMESS v2020.1. The website to download the latest version of GAMESS was not letting me submit the form to request the download to get the latest and that was the latest source I saw on Discovery still in a tarball.

I completed the installation and ran the runall script to test the build and it looks like all tests came back with successful exits. 

I tried it with your script and I am getting the same error message. GAMESS is saying there might be an error in the script:

              *** ERROR(S) DETECTED ***
 YOUR $CONTRL INPUT HAS AT LEAST ONE SPELLING OR LOGIC MISTAKE.
 PLEASE REVIEW THE REASON(S) JUST LISTED, AND TRY YOUR RUN AGAIN.

I am not familiar with the GAMESS input,  so I am not sure what to look for in terms of logic or spelling error. Could you just double check the script again?

Thank you,

Joseph

Adrion :
Hi, I edited the input file to just fit a different system than the one that was initially listed here, and was getting the same error. I also took out the line in the input file with "TDDFT" in it (as the error being returned was a TDDFT error) but that also didn't seem to work; the calculation returned the same error. Hope this helps, thanks!

Cooke :
Hello Daniel,

I am getting the same error message you are receiving and I am looking into it. Do you get similar error messages with other input files of the same type or only this one? I am going to try and build a local instance of GAMESS and see if that build runs the file differently. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Adrion :
I hadn't considered submitting a request for the latest version to be installed. I can take a look at the documentation and see what the latest version is (I know the 2021 version is installed on Discovery but I don't think it's working properly) and can submit a request for it. I was also considering installing it locally in my group's /work folder so that we can modify any of the paths as needed. Thanks

Cooke :
Hello Daniel,

Thank you for letting me know that.  Are you planning on putting in a request for the newest version to be installed on Discovery? 

Thank you,

Joseph

Adrion :
Hi Joseph, feel free to use the input files that I provided. The submission script in that directory (there should be one in there) is not built for discovery as I copied it from somebody on a different cluster, but one can also be written to try and streamline the submission. Let me know if you have any more questions. Thanks

Cooke :
Hello Daniel,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. We can take a look at the installation to see how it was installed and compare it to your error message. 

As for installing a new version of GAMESS, you will need to submit a software installation request ticket ( https://bit.ly/NURC-Software) and we can proceed from there. 

Also is it okay for me to use your input files as a test? Also thank you for providing me the commands to run the program as well.

Thank you,

Joseph

Thanks for reaching out to RC regarding this. 

Could you clarify if you plan to teach a course this semester or are enrolled in a Master's course and need access to Discovery to carry out your thesis work? If it's the later, then you don't need to raise a classroom use request but an access request ticket with us. 

See https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/gettingstarted/index.html and fill out the following form:

Hi again Iain,

I took a look at /scratch/kimpton.i/analysis2/MEP-homoE-1/MEP-homoE-1.log  and the very end of that file has the following:

Error during reading INPORB                                          ###

Do you know where can I find the INPORB ?

Are you still running into this issue?

m.joshi (Work notes) :
Consultation summary attached.

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Iain,

Thanks for booking a consultation with me the other day. Following is what we discussed:

1. Facing issues while running Molcas on the first data file whereas the scripts run fine for the second data file located under /scratch/kimpton.i/homoannulene_ester15

2. Location where the program doesn't run: /scratch/kimpton.i/analysis2/MEP-homoE-1

3. Location where it runs: /scratch/kimpton.i/homoannulene_ester15/MOLCAS/MEP/MEP-1/analysis2/MEP-homoE-1

The decision was to keep looking into the input file and the sbatch file needed to run the program and if there's any difference.

Hi Iain,

Thanks for reaching out to RC regarding this. Are you still experiencing this issue? I just noticed that all your jobs on the lopez and short partitions are currently running, so just wanted to confirm that. 

We did experience some latency on the cluster yesterday due to few processes that were running at the time. It's possible that if you tried to submit the Molcas program during that time, then your submission just caught up in that. Let me know if this is still an issue and we can start looking into it accordingly.

hello oleksandra-

thank you for reaching out to RC !

i've just increased your quota to 35TiB,
which is the max we offer to researchers
at no cost. 

additional space is availble at cost and while
the exact price has not been determined for
this firscal year, expect the price to be ~$155/TiB/year.
(last year it was $141/TiB/year, but we made 
some upgrades to the filesystem),

please let me know if you have any questions
&& happy computing !

hello kiarash-

did your copies finish up ? just checking in.

Tried it, and yes it is showing 12; Is there anyway I can limit it?

Shomo :
not that it matters much, but

xfer: ps U farzad.k | grep -c globus-gridftp
12

Farzad :
Greg,

I canceled one of the copies, which did not start transferring at all. There are 4 remaining that have done some part of the transfer. As I said, probably Globus does 3 at a time. I will not connect to xfer using other apps like WinSCP for this time being. Shall we continue on the transfer? You can check how many processes are copying (I am not sure if I can do that).

Best,
Kiarash

Shomo :
hello kiarash-

you had over 10 processes copying data as
quickly as they could. can you limit yourself
to a single transfer while we work to get our
DTN upgraded (new hardware available) to 
support larger loads ? 

[greg]

Farzad :
Hi Greg,

Thanks for getting back to me.

Globus restricts the transfer to 3 at max itself. 
Although it was 5 transfers, but 3 was only working. 

Also I need to mention that with many other clusters that we are working, we transfer huge datasets like this. And there are times that we need to bring backups back to open them and reuse them, and backup new files. 

Best,
Kiarash

Shomo :
hello kiarash-

thank you for reaching out to RC ! 

yes, we had to suspend globus activity
because your copies were using all the
bandwidth to xfer, basically precluding
anyone else doing work.

were you just running one copy at a time
or did you launch multiple copies ? we need
to figure this out so that we can make sure
that you (and everyone else) can stage data
into and out of the cluster. 

thank you !

RITM Update: Hi Paarthvi,
Yes, let's create the accounts for the students so that they can use SAS Studio at sas-studio.discovery.neu.edu.
Sincerely,
Cuneyt

Sharma :
Hello Cuneyt,

I had a discussion with my team and as the class is only until Aug 22, we would recommend to use the already hosted solutions on discovery instead of creating a dedicated classroom . We can create accounts for the students and they can access it by logging in using those credentials.

We have both SAS and SAS Studio that are available on the discovery cluster. The SAS version 9.4 is accessible as an OOD App and the SAS Studio has its dedicated URL page:

http://sas-studio.discovery.neu.edu

To access the one on OOD (https://ood.discovery.neu.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/) , login to OOD> Interactive Applications> SAS > Launch 

You can test both the solutions and if any of those work for you we can just request the students to login using the credentials to use these.

Please let me know if there are any queries regarding this.

Thanks,
Paarthvi

Shomo :
@Sharma, Paarthvi we just need to create the accounts for these students. they actually won't even be using "discovery" for real ! (weird, but true).

Eroglu :
RITM Update: I do not know what you mean by "classroom" and "files". I just want the students to access the SAS Studio link. SAS Studio should already have a default number of CPUs set up. No GPU is needed.

Sharma :
Hello Cuneyt,

Thankyou for reaching out to RC. We are working on creating the classroom for you.
Could you please let us know the number of CPUs, GPUs and memory you need for the files?

Thanks,
Paarthvi

m.joshi (Work notes) :
@Periaswamy, Surya, I do file &/or folder transfer without the -O option and it's worked for. I believe the main issue was the syntax the user was using. So you've provided him with the right syntax to utilize scp, which is good.

Periaswamy :
Hello Brandon,


Thank you for reaching out to RC. I believe using the -O flag with SCP should resolve this issue.


$ scp -O <file_name> <username>@xfer.discovery.neu.edu:/home/<username>


Please note that the -O implements the original SCP protocol instead of using SFTP.

Could you please give me access to /home/w.saba directory.


Thanks,
Sonali Bandi

Cooke :
Hello Sonali,

I am going to resolve this ticket since we haven't heard back from you in a bit. If you have any other questions please reach out to Research Computing at the following links: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/welcome/gettinghelp.html

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Sonali,

I am just reaching out to see if you have any follow up questions or if there is anything else that I can help with.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Sonali,

Sorry for not being clearer earlier but if you have access to /work/k.church/w.saba, would it be okay to have the data placed there?  Ideally, all research related work should be in a /work directory and we can grant others access to /work directories. It sounds like you both are part of the /work/k.church directory and if the work is related to the PI's work it should be okay to have the data/files be there.

We do not support granting other user's access to user specific home directories for security reasons. 

You can place copies of the files in your /scratch directory but please be aware that /scratch has a 28 day purge policy. 

Please let me know if there is anything else that I can assist you with.

Thank you,

Joseph

Bandi :
Hello Joseph,

There is no directory /work/w.saba. I do have access to this directory /work/k.church/w.saba. 

I was hoping to get access to /home directory of w.saba as a few of the files that I need to continue my research work are in the home directory. I have copied Walid (w.saba) in my mail as well. He is entirely okay with me getting access to his /home directory.

Please let me know if there is any additional information that I need to provide.

Cooke :
Hello Sonali,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing and sorry about the ticket being marked resolved. I am not certain why it was marked resolved.

In terms of granting access to /home/w.saba, we don't grant access to individual /home directories because they are on a per user instance. We prefer all research work to be completed in a /work space which we can add researchers to for collaborations. Is this related to research work in terms of you needing files in /work/w.saba? 

Thank you,

Joseph

Description : Hi I cannot find the pricing for using the discovery cluster. Where can I get this information?

Caplins :
Hi Jeffrey, 

Thank you for contacting RC. I think you will find most of the information you're interested in here under "Getting Access" https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/gettingstarted/get_access.html

For the most part, using the cluster is free and you will simply need to make an account. This will get you access to a /home directory and the /scratch directory. If you need more than the space provided in /home (75 GBs) for storage you can request space in /work which goes up to 35 TBs for free. Beyond that if you need more space there is a charge, but many professors find the 35 TBs to be sufficient. 

Let me know if you have any other questions, 

Serena

Stuart

Caplins :
Hi Stuart, 

Thank you for contacting RC with your request. We have a few specific fields that need to be filled out for the long partition. Do you mind filling them in in this form here: https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0c34d402db0b0010a37cd206ca9619b7

Description : Hello RC Help team,

I'm an incoming machine learning researcher and undergraduate student at Northeastern and will be attending the Oakland campus for my first year. I was hoping to find out if I could gain access to Northeastern's computational clusters to train a genetic algorithm I've been developing, the findings of which will be published shortly after.

I have completed published research<https://independent.academia.edu/AravKumar9> in this field in the past including the invention of a new recurrent neural network architecture<https://link.springer.com/chapter/10.1007/978-981-99-0741-0_23> with double the performance of previous methods, impacts of algorithm design on a model's adversarial robustness, and currently, a study on ensemble LLMs with EleutherAI as well as a bioinformatics drug-target interaction project.

I'm hoping to continue this AI research this year under the Northeastern banner in Oakland and would be greatly honored to have access to our university's computing resources. Thank you for the opportunity and for taking the time to read and respond to this message.

Sincerely,
Arav Kumar

Thanks.  Perhaps the web interface just froze.  It was sitting at the point I sent for several hours.  But, now it appears it did not actually take that long to build.  Next time, I’ll log out and back in.  Didn’t cross my mind this time.  Thanks!

Description : Hi RC Help!

I have tried queuing jobs to A100 but have been getting messages that my sbatch configs are unavailable or that the node that I am requesting is down or drained or reserved for other higher priority jobs.

Are A100 GPU nodes down at the moment? If so, do we have an estimate when they will be back up?

Thanks!

Description : Hello,

I recently switched from TNS employee (with posch.au account) to salaried employee (with new au.posch account). In the transition last week, I had my Discovery - where my main project's computing work lives - access taken away without warning.

Currently I have ticket RITM4427317 in progress to regain access to Discovery via au.posch. Can you expedite this and also re-grant me access to /work/sds-lab in Discovery? Below is a screenshot from when Auroop gave his permission back in May. I've copied him on this email too.

Thanks,

August

hello august-

this should be all set now, but please let me know
if you find something i missed. 

happy computing !

hello august-

this is happening now and i'll let you know
when it is done.

Posch :

upon further inspection, i do need help doing a chown on /work/sds-lab/august and everything inside of it. everything there is currently owned by posch.au but i need it to be owned by au.posch. let me know when you're able to do that.

thanks,

august

Posch :
hi greg-

1. yes it is ok
2. yes it is ok

nothing else needs to be done on my end.

thanks!

august

Shomo :
hello august-

that's good news ! please confirm that it is OK to

1. irrevocably delete /scratch/posch.au 
2. delete /home/posch.au 

and do let us know if you need bits in /work chown'd
from your student account to your staff account.

thank you 
&& happy computing !
[greg]

Posch :
hi greg,

thanks for shedding light on this. i am now able to log in via au.posch and access my files inside /work/sds-lab. amazing!

all i had on /home/posch.au was scratch from when i was first getting on discovery :

thanks for your quick help greg.

august

Shomo :
triage

Shomo :
hello august-

i am sorry to hear this has happened to you. as far
as RC is concerned, your older account is still there
and we did not remove your access. 

if you are unable to login via password, that may 
be due to your role-change. we do not store passwords
on the cluster and defer authentication to active directory
at the university. are you ssh-key friendy ? if so, please
send over the public-portion of your ssh-key and i will
put that into place on the cluster.

additionally, i've just created your new staff account
(au.posch) and added it to the unix group 'gangulylab'.
this takes a couple of hours to propagate throughout 
the cluster, but should be set around 0900 EDT today.

the "right" path forward is to migrate files, etc to 
your new staff account, but let's get you going again
before we worry to much about "right".

again, my apologies for the hiccup here. let's get that
fixed up and then move forwards.

[greg]

Ganguly :
This is business senstitive and time-critical. Please restore access for August. Thanks, Auroop

Description : Hi Nunzio, 

Below is a summary of our consultation.

1. You reported being unable to successfully create a conda environment with tensorflow and python 3.11 due to conflicts with secondary packages (e.g., numpy, pydantic, and typing-extensions).
2. I suggested creating two environments one with tensorflow and the other with the secondary packages
3. We attempted to walk through the conda environment creation on our read the docs documentation
4. You also ran into conflicts here: 
ERROR: pip's dependency resolver does not currently take into account all the packages that are installed. This behaviour is the source of the following dependency conflicts.
triton 2.0.0 requires cmake, which is not installed.
triton 2.0.0 requires lit, which is not installed.
Successfully installed absl-py-1.4.0 astunparse-1.6.3 cachetools-5.3.1 flatbuffers-23.5.26 gast-0.4.0 google-auth-2.22.0 google-auth-oauthlib-1.0.0 google-pasta-0.2.0 grpcio-1.57.0 h5py-3.9.0 keras-2.13.1 libclang-16.0.6 markdown-3.4.4 numpy-1.24.3 oauthlib-3.2.2 opt-einsum-3.3.0 packaging-23.1 protobuf-4.24.1 pyasn1-0.5.0 pyasn1-modules-0.3.0 requests-oauthlib-1.3.1 rsa-4.9 six-1.16.0 tensorboard-2.13.0 tensorboard-data-server-0.7.1 tensorflow-2.13.0 tensorflow-estimator-2.13.0 tensorflow-io-gcs-filesystem-0.33.0 termcolor-2.3.0 typing-extensions-4.5.0 werkzeug-2.3.7 wrapt-1.15.0

My colleague Joe Robinson made an environment with the steps below and we suggested you try that:

module load cuda/11.8 anaconda3/2022.05
conda create --prefix $WORK/TF python=3.11 -y
source activate $WORK/TF
conda install -c conda-forge cudatoolkit=11.8.0
python3 -m pip install nvidia-cudnn-cu11==8.6.0.163 tensorflow==2.13.*
mkdir -p $CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d
echo 'CUDNN_PATH=$(dirname $(python -c "import nvidia.cudnn;print(nvidia.cudnn.__file__)"))' >> $CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh
echo 'export LD_LIBRARY_PATH=$CUDNN_PATH/lib:$CONDA_PREFIX/lib/:$LD_LIBRARY_PATH' >> $CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh
source $CONDA_PREFIX/etc/conda/activate.d/env_vars.sh
python3 -c "import tensorflow as tf; print(tf.config.list_physical_devices('GPU'))"

Hopefully that option will work for you. 

Cheers, 
Serena

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Dave,

Thanks for reaching out to RC regarding this. Seems to me that this was by mistake. Maybe the new faculty didn't realize that they can pick their own name as a sponsor. It is mentioned on our RTD. See https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/first_steps/get_access.html

So quite possible that they ended up picking you as their sponsor by mistake. We do not require any faculty or staff to have a sponsor for the Discovery account.

Description : Hello Mital,

Thanks again for reaching out to RC, and I hope this session was helpful. Here is a summary of what we’ve discussed,


  1.  Launching a JupyterLab Session on OOD and selecting the correct combination of resources for your workflow.
  2.  Going through the Python script and made some changes to get desired results.

Please let me know if you need any further assistance.

Best,

Description : When creating files/folders in the home directory I see the following error.  

[malithjayaweera.d@login-00 ~]$ mkdir tmp-dir
mkdir: cannot create directory ‘tmp-dir’: Disk quota exceeded

I do not see the same issue with the work partition. Linux quota command did not return an output. 

my user id: malithjayaweera.d

Caplins :
Hi Malith Jayaweera, 

Your home directory is over the quota. You can check it with this command (run in your home directory).  The limit is set to 75 GB and you are at 83 GB. 

du -h --max-depth=1 /home/malithjayaweera.d/

It appears a lot of that is your .cache and .conda. We have a few recommendations here to take care of this:

https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/homequota.html

Once you get back under the quota you will be able to create files again. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Hi Marcus,

Thank you for providing information about courses BINF6309 and BINF6201. We will proceed to remove them once this semester has concluded.
In addition, we are working on the new OOD app for BINF6310. Since this course is scheduled for the fall, we'll ensure that it will be ready and available before the start of the semester.

Thanks
Prasanth

Sherman :
RITM Update: Can you also give our students access to a virtual desktop through the "Courses" tab on Discovery OOD? Maybe named "BINF6310."

Also, after this term, we should clean out some of the older courses under that tab. BINF6309/6309 will be going away at the end of the fall term and BINF6201 will likely not be offered again for the foreseeable future.

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Marcus,

Thanks for accepting our request.
The Miniconda version 23.5.2 is now set up and ready to use as a module. You can load the module using:

module load miniconda3/23.5.2

Please let us know if you face any issues using it. If you need any further assistance or have more requirements, feel free to reach out to us.

Best,
Prasanth

Sherman :
RITM Update: Thank you. "miniconda3/23.5.2" is fine so long as it is up-to-date. Student's don't always handle "update is available" warnings all that well.

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Marcus,

Thank you for your detailed response

To add to your points: 

1. With regard to the usage of "conda activate" vs. "source activate", we understand the preference for contemporary commands. Our suggestion of "source activate" is mainly due to it not requiring the "conda init" step, which modifies the bashrc file and can potentially lead to complications for some users. Nonetheless, your students can certainly use "conda activate" once they've executed "conda init". 

2. As for the module naming, we believe that a more general name based on the version number would be better as it can be used by everyone. This way, all users can clearly understand what they are loading. If you're okay with this, we suggest something like "miniconda3/23.5.2". 
This would still allow your students to get acquainted with the module system in HPC environments.


Please let us know your thoughts on naming the module

Best regards,
Prasanth

Sherman :
RITM Update: 1. Yes. We will be teaching the students how to design and maintain virtual environments. We want as minimal of a base environment as possible. Additionally, we want to maintain contemporary commands with conda. That is, the docs suggest using "conda activate ..." but current environments on Discovery require "source activate ..." 

2. We were hoping that it could be a common module so that we further allow students to understand how "module" works in HPC environments vs singularity containers

The 1000 ft view is that, historically, our students were rather unequipped in understanding, creating, and maintaining a pseudo-devops environment. We are hoping to utilize the existing infrastructure on Discovery to organically train students on both use and etiquette.

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hello  Marcus,

Thank you for reaching out to the RC. 
We are glad to inform you that we have successfully created accounts for the students who were previously without access.

As for the installation of the latest Conda version 23.5.2, we'd appreciate your input on a couple of points:

1) Is the requirement for this specific version of Conda critical for the coursework?

2) Would it be acceptable to install this version in the shared space(/courses/<coursename>) allocated for your course, instead of as a general module accessible to all?

Your response will help us understand whether we should proceed with a targeted installation for your course or a general one that would impact all users.

Looking forward to hearing from you.

Best Regards,
Prasanth

Hello Niyathi,

I am going to resolve this ticket since we haven't heard back from you in a bit. If you have any other questions please reach out to Research Computing at the following links: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/welcome/gettinghelp.html

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Niyathi,

I just copied the file to that location. Please let me know if you can open and access it. Do you have any other questions that I can help with? 

Thank you,

Joseph

Srinivasan :
Can you copy it into the directory titled "r-scriptneu"? Thank you so much!

Cooke :
Hello Mary Jo,

Thank you for the permission and I will copy the file for Niyathi. The file might have those permissions to be world accessible but your home directory and sub directory might not have the permissions to be accessible for someone to get to that file. 

Thank you,

Joseph 


Hello Niyathi,

Where would you like me to copy that file for you?

Thank you,

Joseph

Ondrechen :
reply from: m.ondrechen@northeastern.edu

please do copy.  That file should be world accessible.  MJ :

Cooke :
Hello Niyathi,

No worries on the late reply. I will reach out and see if I have permission to copy that file to a location that you have access to for work.

Thank you,

Joseph


Hello Mary Jo, 

Do I have permission to copy /home/m.ondrechen/class/pull_potentials.R to a directory that Niyathi has access to for work?

Thank you,

Joseph

Srinivasan :
Hello, sorry for the late reply. Yes, it would be great if you could copy the file to a location I have access to (after asking Dr. Ondrechen). This is for a research project.

Cooke :
Hello Niyathi,

I am just reaching out to see if there was any follow up on this inquiry and if I should reach out to Mary Jo about getting permission of creating a copy of that file for you. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Niyathi,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing and sorry about the delay in responding to your inquiry. 

'/home/m.ondrechen/' isn't a publicly accessible directory so that is why you cannot copy or access the file you are trying to get. If we get the permission from Mary Jo, we can copy that file to a location that you do have access to. Please let me know if you want to go that route. Also is this for research or for a class?

Thank you,

Joseph

I am trying to copy the file to my personal directory to edit the copy separately. I believe this is an issue with the discovery cluster since I have tried creating new subdirectories and making them public-access for someone else to copy a file into the directory, which did not solve the issue.

Srinivasan :
Hi James,

Sharma :
Hello Peng,

We would recommend requesting for multigpu testing access as your workflow requires the use of GPUs.  I am sharing the documentation link for different partitions that we have on the cluster. The gpu and multigpu partitions span the GPUs on the cluster and the other partitions span the CPUs.

https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/hardware/partitions.html

With the multigpu testing access, we would create a temporary reservation for you with the required number of GPUs on the multigpu partition. The jobs can run up to 24 Hours on this partition and with multiple GPUs you can see how your program can scale and probably run for a shorter amount o f time.

You can raise a request here: https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0c34d402db0b0010a37cd206ca9619b7

Please let me know if you have any other questions!

Description : Hello Meishan,

Thank you for booking a consultation with Research Computing to talk about installing TractSeg. Below is the summary of our conversation.

1. You shared the link to TractSeg and mentioned they had instructions for using the program with Docker but not with Singularity. 
2. I shared that you are able to use `singularity pull` to pull the dockerhub image to Discovery and use it with singularity.
3. I pulled the 2.7 version to the following path for you to test: /shared/container_repository/TractSeg
4. I said that you could use conda to install the latest version 2.8 if there was a specific feature or function you needed in the latest version:

srun --partition=gpu --nodes=1 --gres=gpu:v100-sxm2:1 --cpus-per-task=2 --mem=10GB --time=02:00:00 --pty /bin/bash
module load anaconda3/2022.05 cuda/11.8
conda create --name tractseg python=3.10 -y
source activate tractseg
conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia -y
conda install -c mrtrix3 mrtrix3 -y
pip install scikit-learn
pip install TractSeg

would be the steps to follow to install TractSeg in your conda environment.

Please let me know if this works and if you have any follow up questions.

Thank you,

Joseph

Subject: High Performance Computing options - Northeastern Discovery Cluster

Hello Everyone,

Hope you guys are doing well. As per your request @Diaz, Patrick<mailto:pa.diaz@northeastern.edu> and I were discussing high performance computing for research in our 1:1  today. While we can acquire powerful hardware ownership and maintenance is quite a challenge for global network campuses as teams responsible for maintaining these systems are local to Boston. NU has other resources that serve the same purpose and they are centrally managed.

I wanted to share that Northeastern offers excellent high performance computing resources to students and faculty members who want to pursue research. They offer generous data storage options and its free to use. Northeastern Discovery Cluster gets you access to centralized high performance computing (HPC) clusters, storage, visualization, software, high-level technical and scientific consultations, documentation, and training.

If you need more information please visit: Research Computing at Northeastern University<https://rc.northeastern.edu/>. If you need to setup an account please submit a request to rchelp@northeastern.edu<mailto:rchelp@northeastern.edu>.

Let me know if you have any questions or if you need anything else from me.

Hello Akshat,

I am going to resolve this ticket since we haven't heard from you in a bit. If you have any other questions please reach out to Research Computing at the following links: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/welcome/gettinghelp.html

Thank you,

Hello Akshat,

I am just reaching out to see if you had any follow up questions that I could answer for you.

Thank you,

Cooke :
Hello Akshat,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing and we can absolutely get you started on getting accounts setup. To request an account on the HPC resources we ask you and anyone else who would like an account to submit the following ticket (https://bit.ly/NURC-AccessRequest). This is so we can track it in our system and we can get sponsor approval for your accounts. PI can self sponsor but students will require sponsor approval to get accounts on the HPC.

For storage in /work, a PI needs to submit the request for the storage ticket (https://bit.ly/NURC-NewStorage) and then we will generate it and add in anyone the PI approves to that storage space. 

For other resources, we have a documentation page that outlines best practices, how to connect, and some of the different features and applications that we have on the HPC that people can use. Please look this over and let me know if you have any questions. (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/#_ga=2.29784959.197441704.1690298186-1244983250.1679945103)

Also we have past training sessions recorded and accessible through Canvas (https://northeastern.instructure.com/enroll/LNNCHN).

Please let me know if you have any additional questions that we can talk about.

Thank you,

Joseph

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing and my apologies on the delayed response. 

Have you been able to use R on another node? I just did an srun session and tried 

module load R

Description : Hello,

I am trying to run a script to calculating binding energy in different PDB structures. The script uses GROMACS. I’m running the script many times with different parameters to find trends data we’ve collected. I’ve been running the script with sbatch and it usually looks something like this: sbatch -J 8DZI /scratch/subramanian.i/emargscopy.sh -s 8dzi  -1 C -2 A -3 E -h H -l L. Sometimes, it works like it should, but for a lot of runs, I’m getting an “illegal instruction” error where it rejects all the gmx_mpi commands. This seems to happen randomly and I don’t think it’s tied to my input parameters or the script itself. Is this a problem with a node that each job is being run on? How do I make sure the job runs on a node that is capable? My research professor mentioned that nodes not connected with infiniband will not work.  I’ve attached the script I’m using and one of the error messages.

Thank you,
Ishaan Subramanian

m.joshi (Work notes) :
@Caplins, Serena, "illegal instructions" mean that the software that's being run on a node was not compiled for the microarchitecture of that node. So your solution of --constraint=ib is great.

Caplins :
Hi Ishaan, 

Thank you for contacting RC. Sorry for the delay in responding to you. 

You can restrict which nodes your jobs run on with the --constraint flag. To only use the infiniband nodes this would be in your sbatch script as:

#SBATCH --constraint=ib

Additionally if you find some specific nodes are failing you can use the --exclude flag. Which will look something like this: #SBATCH --exclude=d0127 
and for multiple node: #SBATCH --exclude=d[127-135]

You can find the node your job is currenlty running with 'squeue -u username' or to see past jobs you can use 'sacct -j jobid'

See our documentation for more information: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/hardware/hardware_overview.html

Hope that helps!

Thanks for reaching out to Research Computing.

The normal method to kill a Slurm job is:
$ scancel <jobid>

You can find your jobid with the following command:
$ squeue -u $USER

If the job id is 1234567 then to kill the job:
$ scancel 1234567


In the Future, you can use a compute node whenever you're running a CPU-intensive Task.
You can use the below command for reference:
srun --partition=short --nodes=2 --pty --ntasks=2 --mem=4GB --time=01:00:00 /bin/bash

Description : Last month I submitted the request to install SAMOS onto the cluster and now it's installed. When I load the module "samos/2023-05-17" and try to run some jobs, I always get the error "Illegal instruction". The module gcc/11.1.0 is also loaded. If the gcc/11.1.0 module is not loaded,  I get the error"/lib64/libstdc++.so.6: version `GLIBCXX_3.4.20' not found". I am not sure if any additional modules are needed. Here is the link to the software:https://github.com/sknepneklab/SAMoS. The code is tested in the directory: /work/euler/xinzhi/scratch/spv_samos/SAMoS/configurations/growth

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi LI,

Thanks for raising a new Software installation ticket. We are working on the installation with VTK library support.
We are closing this incident as we are all set here.

Feel free to reach out to us if you have any issues.

Hi Prasanth, Thanks! I have submitted a new request to install SAMoS with VTK support. Really appreciate for your help.

Li :
Hi Prasanth,

Li :
Hi Prasanth,

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hello Li,

I have reviewed your query and it appears that the current installation of SAMoS did not include the VTK library, which is why the ".vtp" files are not being generated. The VTK support was optional during the installation process and wasn't specifically requested in the original software ticket, hence it was not included.

If you'd like us to install SAMoS with VTK support, could you kindly raise a new software installation request through this link: https://bit.ly/NURC-Software, the same way you did for the original SAMoS installation?

Looking forward to your response.

Best Regards,
Prasanth

Li :
Hi Prasanth,

Thanks so much. The samos software is running correctly now. There is one small issue remaining. The code should output both ".vtp" and ".dat" files as specified in line 87-90 in the configuration file, "/work/euler/xinzhi/scratch/spv_samos/SAMoS/configurations/growth/growth.conf ". But I only get ".dat" outputs. I am wondering if samos is compiled with VTK library?  Could you please have a look when you come back to work on Monday? Enjoy the weekend.

Best,
Xinzhi

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hello Li,

Upon examining your code, it appears that SAMoS was compiled for a more recent hardware architecture. To resolve the issue, we suggest designating `--constraint=ib` in your SLURM job script. This directs the scheduler to allocate newer 'd' nodes, where SAMoS has been confirmed to run smoothly.

the former represents an older architecture while the latter is more up-to-date. My testing confirmed that your code executes as expected on these 'd' nodes. :

Please include the following line in your SLURM job script:

#SBATCH --constraint=ib

Give this modification a try, and let us know if it resolves the issue for you. 

Best,
Prasanth

Li :
Hi Prasanth,

Thanks for your timely response.  Yes, I authorize you the permission to copy the files for further investigation about the  "Illegal instruction" error.
For your information, I load all the modules you provide, the error "Illegal instruction" still occurs.
Thanks very much.

Best,
Xinzhi

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Li,

Thank you for reaching out to RC.

When loading a module, it is generally recommended to also load its dependencies. For SAMoS, you can see all the necessary dependencies using the following command:


$ module show samos/2023-05-17

To use the module, type:
module load gcc/11.1.0
module load gsl/2.5
module load python/2.7.15
module load boost/1.80.0 boost/1.80.0-iostream
module load cgal/5.5.2
module load mpfr/4.0.2
module load cmake/3.23.2


This will provide you with a list of all the required modules. Simply copy and execute these commands when you load SAMoS. This should address the dependencies issue.

As for the "Illegal instruction" error, we would like to replicate the issue on our end to investigate further. If you agree, we would like to copy the contents of /work/euler/xinzhi/scratch/spv_samos/SAMoS/configurations/growth for this purpose.

Please let us know if we have your permission to copy the files for further investigation.

Best regards,
Prasanth

Description : Hi,

I recently ran a batched array job, and looking at the job efficiency report I ran into a confusing figure. It claims my job used much more memory than allocated to it:

(base) [wilson.conn@login-01 faster-ilp]$ seff 38246446_56
Job ID: 38246527
Array Job ID: 38246446_56
Cluster: discovery
User/Group: wilson.conn/users
State: COMPLETED (exit code 0)
Cores: 1
CPU Utilized: 03:41:34
CPU Efficiency: 99.90% of 03:41:47 core-walltime
Job Wall-clock time: 03:41:47
Memory Utilized: 51.99 GB
Memory Efficiency: 2662.03% of 1.95 GB

Any idea what’s going on here? Googling this told me that the “memory utilized” figure is based on the high-water mark for memory usage over the life of the process. Can this figure be trusted? All of the batched array jobs reported beyond-capacity memory usage.

Thanks,
Connor Wilson

Caplins :
Hi Connor, 

It may be that the memory efficiency is for the array it's self and not the single job. You can try this command which gives similar information as seff but will output each job in an array separately. 

sacct -P -n -a --format JobID,User,Group,State,Cluster,AllocCPUS,REQMEM,TotalCPU,Elapsed,MaxRSS,ExitCode,NNodes,NTasks -j <job_id>

Hello Kunyuan

Here are the answer to your queries:

1. Yes, to run jobs on the long partition, using the Slurm flag --partition=long would be the approach.

2. Instead of running srun commands, you can submit the job using sbatch. The sbatch command is used to submit a job script for later execution.  Example:

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --time=4:00:00
#SBATCH --job-name=MyJobName
#SBATCH --exclusive
#SBATCH --partition=long

# <commands to execute>

Reference to documentation : https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/slurm.html

To monitor all your jobs, use the following command:
# squeue -u <username>

3. The memory request is large so it can depend on cluster usage for the memory to be assigned.

Thanks,
Paarthvi

RITM Update: reply from: k.qiao@northeastern.edu

Dear Paarthvi,

  Thank you so much for allocating the long partition resource to me! I seem to be able to use it but have some questions


Discovery Shell Access. Then I could type in "cd /work/KunyuanQiao :

module load stata/17-mp

srun --partition=long --nodes=1 --ntasks=1 --mem=2500G --time=120:00:00 --pty /bin/bash

stata-mp -b do mycode.do." Is it a valid approach or do you have some other suggestions?
  2.  Related to the above, I ran several times with the set of commands, and it looks like STATA could run. However, each time I ran it, after several hours, an error message suggested that "Your connection to the remote server has been terminated." Then, the program would stop, and nothing would be produced thereafter. So again, I would appreciate it if you could provide an alternative and more robust way to execute my code.
  3.  I also experimented with the memory ("--mem"). It seems that I need to wait a long time if I assign it to be above 3000G. What is your recommendation for this? I want to have the memory to be as large as possible.

  Thank you!

Hello Kunyuan

We have added you to the long partition. Partitions are logical collections of nodes that comprise different hardware resources and limits to help meet the wide variety of jobs that get scheduled on Discovery. You can requested for multiple nodes as per your requirement. Please refer the below documentation in order to understand the usage:

Qiao :
RITM Update: reply from: k.qiao@northeastern.edu

Dear Paarthvi,

  Thank you and it looks like I need to redo the data and so a long partition is still necessary. I even want to create an additional ticket because one long partition is not enough. Could you help me with that? Thank you!

Best,
Kunyuan

Sharma :
Hello Kunyuan,

That sounds great. Please let me know if I can close this ticket in case long partition is not required anymore.

Thanks,
Paarthvi

Qiao :
RITM Update: reply from: k.qiao@northeastern.edu

Thanks Paarthvi.

I needed some resource that can run my code for a long period of time given the size of my data. But now I have figured out a way to dodge this restriction by slicing the data into tiny pieces.

Best,
Kunyuan

Sharma :
Hello Kunyuan,

Thanks for reaching out to RC with your request! We understand that your code is taking more than 24 hours to run and so you would need long partition access for the same.

The long partition is designed to meet the needs of researchers who have code that needs to run longer than 24 hours and that cannot be checkpointed.

Have you checked if your workflow be checkpointed? The idea behind checkpointing is to be able to run multiple shorter jobs rather than submitting a single long job. It is usually done by saving the latest calculation stage into a checkpoint file, so the next job can load it and continue from the latest stage of the run. This prevents you from losing your data in case a job crashes and allows to monitor and analyze your data frequently. Additionally, it allows to avoid partition time limits.

Thanks,
Paarthvi

Hi Nunzio,

Apologies for a tardy response. As for your questions, as stated on our documentation https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/homequota.html 

you can run the following command to see where the maximum usage is happening. You can even go into the folder SSSS and run the command again to see which sub-folder is taking that much space.

du -shc .[^.]* ~/*

As for /scratch/$USER, capacity is quite high, roughly around a PB, so you don't need to worry about capacity there but the fact that it comes with a 28-day purge policy. This means that the files inside your folder would get deleted if they haven't been touched (modified/updated) in the last 28-days.

Hope that helped. Feel free to book a consultation with us if you need further assistance. See https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/

Hello Joshi! Thank you so much for helping me out with this. A few more questions. 
1) I think I might've installed something in the home folder, because I just have one subfolder in there (SSSS) and there is no way there's 75 GB worth of stuff in there. How can I clean up my home folder?
2) what's the capacity in the scratch folder, usually?

thank you so much for the prompt reply.

Nunzio

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Nunzio,

Thanks for reaching out to RC regarding this. The error message indicates that your $HOME has exceeded the quota of 75 GB for that folder.  

See https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/homequota.html  

And delete or move some of your data off $HOME to either your /scratch (comes with a 28-day purge policy) or /work (if you have access to it).

Description : A new request with request id 55043 has been created by Arjun Singh. Short info on the request is : 

Title : Unable to access Discovery Cluster through Sponsored Account
Category : General Computing
Description : 
 Hello, 

 I previously had a sponsored account with the username: singh.arj with Dr. Josep Jornet, professor, ECE. He also renewed the sponsor account for me with the username: ar.singh, at the end of May.

 The primary purpose of the account is to be able to utilize the OnDemand Portal for Discovery Access. 

 However, I have been running into a host of problems and I would be very grateful for help. 

 With the username of singh.arj, I have the following: 

  1. I have all my work stored in Discovery with this username (work/unlab/singh.arj)
  2. I can access Discovery through SSH, but not OnDemand
  3. I was informed by RC help that the account is currently not included in the database queried via the LDAP protocol, which OOD relies on. 
  4. After reaching out to ITS for help, I was told that I should claim the new sponsored account (ar.singh)

With the username ar.singh, I have the following: 

    1. I don't seem to have permission to access OnDemand or even SSH into Discovery. 
I am sure that I was provided with this access when the sponsored account was created. Is there something that I should ask my sponsor to check? Is there an issue on the backend? At this point, I am not sure what I should do to be able to merge the two accounts, recover my work, and be able to use OnDemand for Discovery access. 

I would be very grateful for your help in the same. 

Regards,
Arjun

Description : Hello!

I'm Maqsood Mansur. I'm a PhD candidate in the Department of Civil and Environmental Engineering. I run the FLOW module of Delft3D previously in the cluster. I was wondering if you could help me with running the WAVE module of Delft3D in the cluster. I will need a different .sh file, right? The one that I have been using for FLOW I attached it with this email. Can you please help me with the changes I need to make to run the WAVE module? I'd be grateful

Sincerely,
Maqsood Mansur

Mansur :
Hello! No worries about the delay. This is really, really helpful. Thank you so very much! I will let you know if I run into any issues.

Caplins :
Hello Maqsood, 

Sorry for the long delay in getting back to you. I have not had an easy time finding the information on delft3d but did finally find the resources that I think you need to change the script. You need a new config file (specifically a master definition wave file or .mdw) and need to make a few changes in the sbatch slurm script. I've pasted below an example of the slurm script. It works as written with the test.mdw (which I downloaded from the repo below) but is missing some additional input files (a grid file) and returns an error message saying it couldn't find the grid file.

I wish I could help a bit further but feel it is beyond my scope...what I need next is the actual data or parameters for the model. But hopefully this is enough information to get you going again. 

The guidelines I found suggest making the .mdw file in the gui before running it in an sbatch script. I suggest you take a look at this document and try to make a .mdw file for input to the script: file:///Users/s.caplins/Downloads/Delft3D-WAVE_User_Manual[1]%20(1).pdf

Additionally you may find this guide useful: https://apps.dtic.mil/sti/pdfs/AD1184381.pdf
And you may find this repo helpful as it has an example .mdw file https://svn.oss.deltares.nl/repos/delft3d/tags/delft3dfm/68819/examples/07_wave/
And this pdf which has example data and scripts https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2352340919312764

Note the example script is calling delft3d modules but the submit_SLURM.sh script is running a container. You do not need to do both. With the modifications to the slurm script below the program runs and there is no need for the example_script.sh to be called. You do need the mpich and singularity scripts to run the container. 

You just need to call the wave module with the command "wave" which comes after running the container. The "wave" command then needs the .mdw file and an output file. 

Let me know if you need any additional help. Delft3d could really use a nicely written tutorial for the command line......none exists that I could find. :)

Cheers, 
Serena

Modified submit_SLURM.sh script:

#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --nodes=1
#SBATCH --ntasks=56
#SBATCH --time=16:00:00
#SBATCH --job-name=m1
#SBATCH --partition=short


#Load the Singularity module in order to run a container:
module load singularity/3.5.3
#Load the MPI libraries outside the container:
module load mpich/3.3.2

#Run the Singularity container , bind your Discovery working directory to a directory inside the container and run the example_script.sh script on the same amount of ntasks you requested in the SLURM script.
#Since the MPI library is called outside the container, use command 'mpirun' and specify the number of MPI tasks outside the container:

mpirun -n 56 singularity run -B $PWD:/opt/work /shared/centos7/delft3d/container_images/delft3d.simg wave test.mdw  > output_waves

Mansur :
Sure! Thank you so much!

Caplins :
Okay. Thank you for clarifying. I'll get back to you as soon as I can.

Mansur :
Yes, "example_script" is the one that I have been using for FLOW module of Delft3D. I wanted to run the WAVE module. Just wanted to know what changes I need to bring to the script. I haven't tried running it since this script is for the FLOW module.

Caplins :
Hi Maqsood, 

Forgot to add, have you tried running this yet and what were the errors if any?

Thank you, S

Caplins :
Hi Maqsood, 

I will start working on this and get back to you as soon as possible. Just to confirm the script called "example_script" is the one you were using previously? 

Thank you, 
Serena

hello leticia-

thank you for reaching out to RC ! 

it looks like you just ran out of memory. the last line in the 
error output you included reads

numpy.core._exceptions.MemoryError: Unable to allocate 160. GiB for an array with shape (5, 4294967302) and data type float64

and if this one of your jobs that requests 16 cores
and 8G of memory per core, then any request > 128G 
will fail.

i would just up your memory to 9G per core and see
if that gets you through.

good luck

Description : Good day,

I am a new Associate professor at the Econ department. I recently got access to Discovery. I want to run a program that estimates the parameters of a structural model on Matlab. The program is time-intensive (but only uses a few resources). I estimate the program will take at least two weeks to run. I appreciate your guidance on the best way of submitting and running the code.

I booked a consultation appointment at 1:30 p.m. today, but I'm still waiting for someone to attend. I booked another at 2:30 p.m., hoping someone can help me.

Who did you book the consultations with and apologies on someone missing the first one. 

For the matlab code you are using, can you checkpoint it or have it save that state periodically during the calculation? Is it a code that you wrote or is it an open source project that is running in matlab? 

Thank you,

Caplins :
Hi Rajagopal, 

We got the "missing" students fixed. I now count 56 there. So some may have joined after the classroom request was made. 

Yes you have GPUs. You can use them by selecting the flags "partition=courses-gpu" and the "--gres=gpu:1"

We also have a CPU partition for courses which can be selected with "partition=courses" and the students are also able to use the "short" and "gpu" partitions but we do prefer that you using the courses partition as much as possible. 

I'll send an email with everything laid out now for both courses. 

Thank you, 
Serena

Venkatesaramani :
RITM Update: Hi Serena,

Thanks for the updates! The bit about missing students is a bit odd, I see 54 students still enrolled in my section, and I actually pulled the roster from Canvas by generating a report. Not sure what's going wrong there.

just wanted to confirm if the current setup does include GPU access as well? :

Regards
Raj

Caplins :
Hi Rajagopal, 

We are nearly there in setting up your course. We made a directory under /courses for CS4100.202410 which has sub directories for staff and students and a shared directory for data. The students can read from /data and staff can read and write to /data

Our scripts pull data from canvas to build the courses directories. I notice that we only have 25 students in your courses directory but there are 54 in the roster you provided. Are their perhaps 2 sections or has enrollment changed?

I have also built a conda environement for the course which can be activated with the following commands:

srun --pty bash   #this will provide a 4 hour session on the short partition with 1 node 1 core and 2 GBs of RAM you can modify if more is needed
module load anaconda3/2022.05
source activate /shared/centos7/classes_conda_envs/CS4100

Please let me know about the "missing" students above. The space and conda environment are ready to use, but I'm sure you want the whole course to have access. 

I will have an update for class CS5100 as well (short update is the conda env is ready. The directories are not)

Cheers, 
Serena

Venkatesaramani :
RITM Update: The section and term code is CS4100.19749.202410 (Fall 2023, Section 2, Boston) for CS 4100. Thanks!

Caplins :
Hi Rajagopal, 

For course CS4100 can you provide the specific section and term codes? It appears there are many courses with CS4100 in the canvas database and we need to find the correct one to get you set up. 

Thank you, 
Serena

Venkatesaramani :
are students able to upload datasets and code files as well :

Caplins :
Hi Rajagopal, 

Thank you for submitting your classroom request. I wanted to ask if you need an application to accompany your classroom request?

For example I can install the packages you listed in a conda environment which you can access via a Jupyterlab app, which would be accessible on the Open On Demand app under 'courses'. Would that be sufficient for your needs?

We typically ask for a few days to 1 week to complete classroom requests, but I will try and have things set up for you by the end of this week.
Many thanks, 

Serena Caplins

Description : Hello,

I'm trying to rsync data from google cloud to RC (my research group directory, mhealthresearchgroup), but I cannot install Google CLI on RC. I also said I do not have sudo permissions to install python packages. Do you know what is causing this and how to fix it?

Ha

Caplins :
Hi Ha, 

I haven't heard back from you yet. I am closing this ticket. If you would like assistance setting up rclone to google cloud please reach out via a consultation, or open another ticket. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Caplins :
Hi Ha, 

Just wanted to touch base with you here again. We have some internal documentation on using rclone to transfer data between discovery and cloud storage. And there is also this guide though it is not specific to Discovery. https://rclone.org/googlecloudstorage/

You could then use a task scheduler to automate the file transfer. 

Feel free to reach out if you'd like assistance doing either of those. 

Cheers, 
Serena

m.joshi (Work notes) :
@Caplins, Serena, do we have the process documented somewhere on Notion? He also has a ticket opened that Greg had responded to on the same thing. See INC11928144

Did you get a chance to talk to Greg about it?

Caplins :
Hi Ha, 

We have rsync installed on the cluster. You don't need to install Google CLI on the discovery cluster, but would rather install it locally on your laptop/desktop and use it to mount the google cloud to your local machine. You would then use rsync to transfer files from google cloud to discovery. 

I'm happy to book a consultation to walk you through this process. You can book a consultation with me here: https://outlook.office365.com/owa/calendar/ResearchComputing2@northeastern.onmicrosoft.com/bookings/

As for having permissions to install python packages. We recommend that you use a package manager like conda or pip to install python packages (which with install locally on your /home or other directory and don't require sudo permissions). You can find our documentation on doing so here: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/packagemanagers/conda.html#conda

Thank you,

those nodes both boot up, do nothing successfully
for about 10m, and then powerdown with hardware
errors. this has been true since the annual maintenance
on 06 june 2023.

i have personally power-cycled those machines at
least three times and watched them power-off due
to temperature warnings twice (forgot to time it the
first time).

we are working on these systems also.

i just answered this in teams, but as that was

2. /work/smile crossed a file-count quota. i have

increased that quota by 5M files, but folks should

check to see if they can cleanup a bit.



1.yes, these nodes have hardware problems and

we have been working with nvidia (for months) to

Here you can run the "list" command to see the directories and then switch depending on the requirement:

# ls                                                  #Provides a list of the directories 
# cd <directory_name>     # Change to /Researchers or /Data_raw
# pwd                                           #To check the current working directory

Please let me know if you need help with this!

Hi Paarthvi,

Though I can now login to Discovery using the terminal (but not OOD), I'm still having trouble accessing Dr. Post's shared files for research (/work/postresearch/Shared files). It's entirely possible I'm looking in the wrong place on the terminal, as I am not familiar with MobaXTerm. For reference, please see the attached screenshot.

Thanks,

Description : Dear Discovery Admin,

I was wondering if you could help grant the following access to Joseph Gu (gu.jo@northeastern.edu<mailto:gu.jo@northeastern.edu>) and Sai Kumar Reddy (manne.sa@northeastern.edu<mailto:manne.sa@northeastern.edu>).

  1.  Add them to the ‘jiang’ patition.
  2.  Grant them read and write access to the /work/vig directory.

Also, I was wondering if there is any way of adding and removing people such access because students come and go. It may be cumbersome to ask for your help each time. My understanding is that they are all in the same user group. Would it be possible to give me the admin privilege of my user group?

Hello Huaizu,


I had a discussion with the system admins about giving you admin access to your partition, turns out that's not possible currently due to technical issues. A couple of pipelines are being built to make this possible, but that's something for tomorrow. Hope that answers your question.


Thank you,
Surya

Periaswamy :
Hello Huaizu,

We have added students to the Jiang partition and granted them access to the /work/vig directory. Please note that it takes a couple of hours for the change to propagate through the system.

Hi Turner,

We have installed MPI in various module formats on our Discovery cluster, specifically mpich, openmpi, and Intel MPI. You can access the available versions with the following commands:


$ module avail mpi
$ module avail openmpi
$ module avail intel/mpi


After you've chosen your desired MPI version, you can retrieve its path using the `module show` command. For instance, if you want to view details for `openmpi/4.1.2-gcc11.1`, use:


module show openmpi/4.1.2-gcc11.1


This will display the paths for the library and binary. Alternatively, you can directly load the module (e.g., `module load openmpi/4.1.2-gcc11.1`) and use the `which` command to get the path for `mpirun`, as shown below:

$ module load openmpi/4.1.2-gcc11.1
$ which mpirun
/shared/centos7/openmpi/4.1.2-gcc11.1/bin/mpirun


You can then include these binary or library paths as needed during your software installation. 
If you're just aiming to assign the compilers, you can use `export CC=mpicc` during the installation process.

Please don't hesitate to reach out if you require further assistance.

Best regards,
Prasanth

we do create special unix groups to manage

do you require all 35T right-away ? if not, we

hello hitanshu-

thank you for reaching out to RC ! 

our storage application form is a bit out-dated,
so i have a couple of follow-up questions. 

1. does this dataset require encryption-at-rest ? 
we usually only offer that for data that includes PHI
or is PII. 

2. is there a DUA that governs who can access 
the data ? 

depending on those answers, there may be
some additional questions. do you have some 
time early next week to meet up and walk 
through them ?

thank you

Hello Yash,


Once the binary is built you will need to install the Python interface for LightGBM as mentioned here: https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GPU-Tutorial.html#install-python-interface-optional this should allow you to use your conda environment with your Jupyter notebooks.

Hello Yash,

I was able to get LightGBM with GPU support built.  Here are the steps I followed

$srun --partition=gpu --nodes=1 --gres=gpu:v100-sxm2:1 --cpus-per-task=2 --mem=10GB --time=02:00:00 --pty /bin/bash :
Load the required modules:
$module load cmake
$module load boost
$module load cuda
$module load anaconda3
Create a conda environment for this installation: $conda env create -n lightGBM -y
$git clone --recursive https://github.com/microsoft/LightGBM :
$cd LightGBM; mkdir build :
Move to the build directory and compile LightGBM using CMake, Making sure that the Use_GPU Option is specified:
$ cd build 
$ cmake -DUSE_GPU=1 -DOpenCL_LIBRARY=/shared/centos7/cuda/11.0/lib64/libOpenCL.so -DOpenCL_INCLUDE_DIR=/shared/centos7/cuda/include/ -DBoost_DIR=/shared/centos7/boost/1.80.0-iostream/ ..
Move back to the source and make the binary: $ cd ..; make -j$(nproc)
This should get LightGBM installed with GPU support, You can install a Python interface for the binary to work with your programs: https://lightgbm.readthedocs.io/en/latest/GPU-Tutorial.html#install-python-interface-optional (Note: Please proceed with the installation without using the sudo command).

Please try this out and let me know if it works.

Description : Hi Griffin, 

Thank you for booking a general consultation with Research Computing. Below you will find a summary of what we discussed.
1. Griffen was running into glibc errors when trying to install several packages in RStudio on the OOD app. 
2. We were able to install the package BSgenome in a conda environment that we had previously created via this site to run Saige: https://saigegit.github.io/SAIGE-doc/docs/Installation_conda.html
3. We then used pip to install the rpy2 library. Following this tutorial: https://anderfernandez.com/en/blog/how-to-program-with-python-and-r-in-the-same-jupyter-notebook/
4. We then used this environment to launch a jupyterlab notebook on the OOD. The first line needs to be: %load_ext rpy2.ipython 
5. And R commands need to be preceded with an R. 

I will test the functionality further, but seems a promising route to getting newer R packages installed on discovery.

I have allocated a node with GPUs in a terminal, for example, fugpu c4028. When I need to login to c4028 in another terminal by typing "ssh c4028", the system requires me to input the password.

But I do not know what the password is. I have tried with my login password for the login node, but it failed.

How to login an allocated node? :


Hello Jianglin,

To SSH to an allocated compute node from a login node, you need to set up password less SSH between the login node and the compute node. Please note that both the nodes are in the cluster and you need to set up password less SSH between the login node i.e [login-01, login-00] and compute node i.e [c4028, c0211, etc]. The instructions to set up password less SSH between the login node and compute node are similar to the instructions to set up password less SSH between MAC (local machine) and login node (Discovery) since both are unix based.

Please note that both the nodes are in the cluster and you need to set up password less SSH between the login node i.e [login-01, login-00] and compute node i.e [c4028, c0211, etc]. The instructions to set up password less SSH between the login node and compute node are similar to the instructions to set up password less SSH between MAC (local machine) and login node (Discovery) since both are unix based.

https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/first_steps/connect_mac.html#passwordless-ssh :

I hope this clarified my previous email.

Best,

Hi, Surya,

I have set up password less SSH. I can login from my local laptop to the login node without a password.

But the problem is that, when I need to SSH to a compute node from the login node, the system requires me to input the password. I don't know what the password is. I have tried my login password, but it doesn't work.

Again, how to login to a compute node (e.g., c4028) from the login node (e.g., lu.jiang@login-00)?  I use the command "SSH c4028", but the system requires a password (it is not my login password).

Best,
Jianglin

How to login an allocated node? :

Hello Jianglin,

Thanks for reaching out to RC.

You can SSH to a compute node once you have set up password less SSH between the login node and compute nodes. To do that, please follow the instructions provided here: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/first_steps/connect_mac.html#passwordless-ssh
If you're using windows, the same steps would apply since the setup inside the cluster.
Optionally, you can also follow the full set of instructions to set up password less SSH between your local computer and the cluster login node.

Hello Bingyu,

Thank you for reaching out to RC. The error message that you have attached states that you have exceeded the quota limit of your /home. Every user has 75 Gb of storage in /home. I would recommend you to check your storage. Once you free up the space, you will be able to launch the notebook.

Description : Dear RC team,

I'm kind of new to Discovery, so I have some questions about setting up my computing environment.

I need to run some R code in parallel and from time to time the program needs to call Python. The program uses four R packages, "igraph", "doParallel", "sRACIPE" and "reticulate" and needs to call some python packages that are not in the basic python ("POT").

1) What would be the best way to proceed? Should I make a directory where to install all the necessary R and Python packages? I see that using R in conda allows you to install only certain packages, sRACIPE is not amongst them.

2)How do I install these packages from the command line? Is it possible to install the R packages from within the R code, i.e. can I write something like install.packages(c("doParallel","igraph","sRACIPE","reticulate")...)?
If yes, what is the exact command to do that?

3) Can you please take a look at the file in attachment and tell me if this would be fine as a job submission file?

4) I see that maximum allowed time for a gpu job is 8 hours? Can it be extended? My job would probably need to run for 2-3 days.

Thank you.

Dear c.caranica,

We have noticed that you're running CPU-intensive processes on one of the login nodes(login-01), as detailed below.

/sys/fs/cgroup/cpu/user.slice/user-1825723989.slice:
└─session-52632.scope

CPU usage: 39%
You should not use the login node for CPU intensive activities, as this can impact the performance of this node for all cluster users.
Also, It will not give you the best performance for the tasks you are trying to do. Please reference our documentation for more information: Next steps<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/index.html>.

If you are trying to run a job, you should move to a compute node. You can do this interactively using the srun command or non-interactively using sbatch command. Please see our documentation on how to do this: Using sbatch<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/sbatch.html>; Using srun<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/srun.html>.

If you are trying to transfer data, we have a dedicated transfer node that you should use. Please see our documentation on transferring data for more information: Transferring Data<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html>.

Hi Serena,

I don't see the .yml file.
You can just load it on my home directory, if you have time.

I will see you at 4pm.

Best,
Cristian

Caplins :
Hi Cristian, 

I think I have a solution. I have added r-base and the other R packages you listed to a conda environment that also has python (3.9) and the pot package. 

I am able to load the numpy and ot modules without error. 

I have exported the contents of the conda environment to a .yml file. You can recreate the environment in your home with this command: 

module load anaconda3/2022.05

conda env create -f pyR_environment.yml

It took me less than 20 minutes to recreate this environment from the .yml file. 

You will need to modify your sbatch script to contain the following:

module load anaconda3/2022.05

#run conda

eval "$(conda shell.bash hook)"

conda activate pyR

Rscript sracTest_sinkhorn.R

Happy to walk you though this at 4 PM today.  I've attached the pyR_environment.yml file here but I can also copy it to your home directory if you prefer. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Hi Serena,

You can try python 3.7.
Let's meet at 4:00pm, if possible.

Thank you.
Cristian

Caplins :
Hi Cristian, 

Yes I spent sometime working on it yesterday. I did try to export the LD_LIBRARY_PATH and this works when run in the sbatch script. And the correct paths are returned in the rscript with the py_config() command. However, the same GLIBC error is returned when I try to import the "ot" module. The issue is an incompatibility with the compilers in the Rstudio container and the conda environment. 

It doesn't appear there are any easy solutions, but I have a few things I would like to try this morning. One is to downgrade the python version in the conda environment. Would that cause any issue for you? I tried python 3.9 yesterday and it still didn't work, but python 3.7 might. 

A second solution is to run R through a conda environment and not use the Rstudio container. I think most of the conflicts from using rstudio. But we don't need rstudio and can just install base R and the other R packages that you need. 

I would like to try both of those solutions and get back to you. I think there is hope, but it is not as straightforward as we might want. 

As for a consultation today. I am free from 12 to 1 and then after 4pm EST. Lots of meetings today. 

Cheers, 
Serena

It shouldn't take long.

We might just need to add the path to the lib folder in anaconda to LD_LIBRARY_PATH.
If this is not working, I will just give up on using that package.

Thank you.

I don't know if you can fix that, it would save a lot of computational time.
If not, I would do without it.

Caplins :
another solution is to use miniconda3 in /home or /work, but the user in this case was using the anaconda module

Caplins :
Hi Cristian, 

I am able to get the function use_condaenv() to work. I am also able to get the same error message that you were getting so I think I have isolated the problem. 

The issue seems to be using the anaconda modules, which are located in the shared directory, but that directory needs to be bound to the container, in order for the container to "see" it. 

So if you simply modify your sbatch script to included the /shared directory as follows:

singularity run -B "/shared:/shared,/scratch:/scratch,/work:/work" /shared/container_repository/rstudio/rocker-geospatial-4.2.1.sif Rscript nameofscript.R

That should be all you have to do and it will work. 

Please let me know if that is not the case and we can arrange another consultation. 

Cheers, 
Serena

@Joshi, Manasvita @Robinson, Joe @Cooke, Joseph

I just realized it's Friday evening (guess that means I'm really on vacation if I've lost track of the day). So I went ahead and copied the env to his home and changed over the permissions to him.....not sure that's the best solution. But that's what he's asking for.

Caplins :
Hi Cristian, 

I've copied over an environment with all of the R packages you requested to your home directory. It's called 'Renv'.  You will need to launch rstudio from within the xfce desktop on the OOD by typing 'rstudio' in the terminal. Note the R package sracipe is available through the bioconductor channel https://anaconda.org/bioconda/bioconductor-sracipe

If you need to install additional R packages you can install them using the normal install.packages() function and they will be installed in your conda environment. 

I wasn't able to install the 'pot' package as I too ran into too many conflicts.  I don't know what other python packages you will be needed but you can try adding them to this environment.

Let me know if this is a workable solution for you. Another option is to install these R packages in Rstudio on the OOD using packrat as mentioned by my colleague and running your python code from within your R script. Happy to meet with you in a consultation regarding how to do this when I return from vacation on the 21st. 


Cheers, 
Serena

Caplins :
The Renv environment in my work has all the packages he requested installed.

Caplins :
Hi @Joshi, Manasvita @Cooke, Joseph @Robinson, Joe

I have a conda env in my work directory here: /work/rc/s.caplins/miniconda3/envs/Renv 

You could also create a .yml file from that environment for him as an alternative solution. 

This environment has all of the packages that he needs. If someone wants to copy it to him and change permissions please feel free. He can run it in an xfce desktop on the ood. But I really don't know why he can't just install them in Rstudio on the OOD. He seems very lost. 

Sorry about the confusion on my part in answering his query. I answered with what he seemed to be asking for and then realized that it is likely not necessary.

Caranica :
reply from: c.caranica@northeastern.edu

Hi Joshi,

I've looked at packrat documentation, I don't know whether will work or not. Please try to install it somewhere in my home directory and see if you can install those R packages.

Hi Cristian,

Sorry about the delay in resolving your issue. Serena is currently OOO and our team is now currently looking into your issue. 

In order to help you out with package installation in R outside of the conda environment, we would like to test out these installations using packrat to see if that solves the problem. But in the meantime, you can also go through our documentation on Packrat and see if that works for you.

Caranica :
reply from: c.caranica@northeastern.edu

Hi Serena,

Hi Serena,

I'm really lost about using OOD to create a conda environment containing R packages. The documentation is just confusing for me. There are 3 ways described in the docs for installing R.
Maybe you can manage to create a conda environment containing r-base, rstudio, sRACIPE and doParallel. Or at least r-base and rstudio. And then maybe you can explain me how to install the other two using rstudio and how can I call python packages from a different environment.

If you're on vacation, please ask somebody else to do this.

Thank you.
Cristian

Caplins :
Hi Cristian, 

I should have asked at the beginning but have you tried installing these r packages in the Rstudio Open on Demand app? https://ood.discovery.neu.edu:5554/auth/ldap/login?back=&state=yqeplvmj2bvxd4alfckwwmmm6

You will want to specify the 'geospatial' flavor as it has many packages and their compilers pre-installed. You can then activate a conda environment from within your r scripts using reticulate or via the 'terminal' window in rstudio. It sounds like you have a conda environment set up with the python packages just not the R, but these don't have to be in the same place to work. 

In case the OOD app doesn't work, I'm am still building a bespoke conda environment. I have r-base and rstudio installed and am adding in the other r packages. If I'm mixing python and r packages in conda I like to start with the r packages as there are often fewer supported versions than the python packages. I'll built this environment and then I can copy it to your home. 

But do try the OOD app and see if that works for you. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Caranica :
reply from: c.caranica@northeastern.edu

Hi Serena,

You can go to my home directory , make a directory there and create an environment if you can.
In the worst case, I would be satisfied with an environment having only those R packages, r-base, rscript, sRACIPE, doParallel, and igraph if possible. I could replace the python code with R code and also replace the code calling functions from igraph. It would be slower, but still okay.

Thank you very much.

Cristian

Caplins :
Hi Cristian, 

I will give it a try tonight and tomorrow morning. I have also had this issue with conda going incredibly slow when installing r-base. It seems to go faster if you can make a .yml file. If I can get an environment made for you I can give you a .yml file and you can recreate it. 

I am leaving for vacation tomorrow. If I'm unable to get your environment made I'll pass this ticket on to a colleague. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Caplins :
Hi Cristian, 

Thank you for reaching out to RC with your questions. Below I have provided answers to each question in order. 

1 (and 2). I recommend installing the python and R packages in a conda environment. You can set up a conda environment with all of the python packages and some of the R packages (Yes, not all R packages are able to be installed via conda). You will need to install r-base and rstudio in the conda environment. Once the environment is created and packages are installed you can run Rstudio from your conda environment (See notes on how to do this below). Then from within Rstudio you can install the R packages like sRACIPE. These will be stored within the conda environment that is running R. 

We have some information on creating a conda environment here: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/conda.html

3) You should use the command 'Rscript' to run a .R script. Otherwise the script will run as written. If you are running through a conda environment you will need to activate your conda environment in the sbatch script instead of loading an R module. 

4) You can apply for access to the multigpu partition which in addition to mulitple GPUs also has longer run times. However we require some benchmarking of code to be sure things are running efficiently prior to giving you access. You can apply for access here: https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0c34d402db0b0010a37cd206ca9619b7

Running Rstudio through a conda environment:

Create the conda environment and install packages, must include r-base and rstudio. 
Launch an instance on the Open OnDemand app for the 'Discovery (xfce4)' Interactive Desktop app. 
Activate your conda environment
run Rstudio with the command: rstudio
This should open an rstudio session in which you can install packages from R

If you find it is taking a very long time to install packages in the conda environment you can try disabling channel priority with this command (run within your activated conda environment): conda config --set channel_priority disabled 

(see here for more info: https://conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-channels.html)

Let me know if you'd like any help with the above. I am working on documentation for using conda and Rstudio but it is still a work in progress. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Description : Hi Greg, 

Apologies for opening a new ticket on the discovery storage permissions issue. I thought it was resolved earlier, but something seems to be going wrong. 

When I create new folders in /work/ubiwell-lab, they don’t inherit the ACL permissions from ubiwell-lab. Instead they are being set with group as ‘users’. 

I created a new folder called ’test_rsync’ and even setfacl to allow group rwx permissions and change group of ‘test_rsync’ from ‘users’ to ’stress-free.’ However, now when I create a subfolder, the parent folder permissions aren’t inherited and instead the group is again set to ‘users’. How do avoid manually having to change permissions all the time? 

Another example is that if someone creates a new file/folder inside ’test_rsync’, and does chmod 700, I no longer have access to it, even though the default acl policy says that my user should have rwx access. When I check getfacl, it has a comment “#effective: —“ 

I am sorry for the bother, but I think something broke somewhere… or maybe I misunderstood something. 

Thanks, 
-varun

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :

Hi Manasvita,

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Varun,

Thanks for reaching out to RC and apologies for the delay in responding as we are currently understaffed. Are you still experiencing this issue? Were you able to book a consultation with someone from RC to discuss this further?

Did you use the -R flag to set permissions for all the sub-folders inside the main folder? Also, while using setfacl, one needs to do the following to ensure that the permissions propagate all the way through to the deeper nested folders:

# check current ACLs
getfacl /work/<project>

#Give read & execute permissions to the parent directory (allow user access to the parent directory)
# repeat for directories with deeper nesting
setfacl -m <username>:r-x /work/<project> 

#Set default acl and give rwx permissions to the desired folder
setfacl -d -Rm <username>:rwx /work/<project>/foo 

#Set working acl so that all files are affected with the change
setfacl -Rm <username>:rwx /work/<project>/foo

Let me know if that helped and sorry once again for a tardy response.

Best,

Description : Dear Sir/Ma'am,

My name is Aryan Fernandes, and I am currently enrolled in the Master of Science program in Data Analytics and Engineering (DAE) at NEU. I am writing to request GPU access for a research project that I am working on as part of my academic pursuits.

The focus of my project involves testing and fine-tuning various language models, including but not limited to LLaMA2, GPT-3, and other Large Language Models (LLMs). These models are critical components of my research, and having access to a GPU is essential to ensure the efficiency and effectiveness of my work.

Thank you for considering my request for GPU access. I look forward to your positive response. Please feel free to contact me if you require any further information or if there are any formal procedures I need to follow.

I keep getting the error “Disk Quota Exceeded” when attempting to write to files or creating new files. I know this is not a storage issue but rather some other limitation. Is there a way to resolve this? My user id is yu.calv. Thanks.

Hi Calvin, 

No recent change. There are "soft" and "hard" limits that eventually limit your ability to do work as you see with the warnings you've been seeing. 

We suggest keeping an eye on your home usage via the link I sent you. 

Cheers,

How was I able to exceed 75 GB? Did the limits recently change?

Hi Calvin, 

It looks like you've exceeded the limit of your home directory. The limit is 75 GB and you're at 83 GB. Here are a few tips to check your usage as well as to keep it under the limit.

Description : Hello,

I previously had a sponsored account with the username: singh.arj with Dr. Josep Jornet, professor, ECE. He also renewed the sponsor account for me with the username: ar.singh, at the end of May.

The primary purpose of the account is to be able to utilize the OnDemand Portal for Discovery Access.

However, I have been running into a host of problems and I would be very grateful for help.

With the username of singh.arj, I have the following:

  1.  I have all my work stored in Discovery with this username (work/unlab/singh.arj)
  2.  I can access Discovery through SSH, but not OnDemand
  3.  I was informed by RC help that the account is currently not included in the database queried via the LDAP protocol, which OOD relies on.
  4.  After reaching out to ITS for help, I was told that I should claim the new sponsored account (ar.singh)

With the username ar.singh, I have the following:

  1.  I don't seem to have permission to access OnDemand or even SSH into Discovery.

I am sure that I was provided with this access when the sponsored account was created. Is there something that I should ask my sponsor to check? Is there an issue on the backend? At this point, I am not sure what I should do to be able to merge the two accounts, recover my work, and be able to use OnDemand for Discovery access.

I would be very grateful for your help in the same.

Description : ATTN: @DWADASI, PRASANTH<mailto:p.dwadasi@northeastern.edu>

This is in reference to a resolved task TASK6028653.

A new and updated version of miniconda was installed for my bioinformatics course (miniconda3/23.5.2). The aim of this install was to provide a "blank canvas" for my students to learn how to install programs and create virtual environments using conda.

Last week, I loaded the module and activated the base environment, but was unable to create any new environments. I kept getting "permission denied." I attempted to resolve the issue by explicitly giving a path to install that was in my home directory, but nothing fixed it. As of right now, I feel like I am going to have to have the students install miniconda in their own home directories to get around this. Is there any way to resolve this? I would love to teach the students the importance and flexibility of modules.

Caplins :
HI Marcus, 

Great to hear! Thank you for your continued testing!

I'll close this ticket now.  But feel free to reach out if you need anything else. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Sherman :
It appears that the issue is resolved. Thank you for your hard work, Serena!

Caplins :
Hi Marcus, 

I think we have it working now. Sorry about that. My earlier test was with the default module of miniconda3. The 23.5.2 version only worked for me when I changed both owner and group to root. I have had a few colleagues test it as well and it should be okay now. 

Let me know if that works on your end. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Sherman :
The reason that I requested miniconda is so that students don't get lazy and use pre-installed packages. I want them to be deliberate in setting up their variables.

From what I can tell, the only difference between the builds of miniconda3/23.5.2 and anaconda3/2022.05 is the owner of the files (p.dwadsi and root, respectively; seen below).

Caplins :
Hi Marcus, 

Sounds good. Thank you for trying and sorry that didn't resolve it immediately. 

In the meantime, if the module doesn't have to be miniconda,  The students could also make new environments with one of the anaconda modules that we have available. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Sherman :
Below is the screenshot of my attempt after you told me to try. It appears that I still do not have access. I think I should try tomorrow in the hopes that it propagates out to the other clusters.

Caplins :
Hi Marcus, 

Do you mind trying it now. The permission were set to rc on that 23.5.2 folder, but I have changed them to users. Please let me know if that works for you now. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Sherman :
And the second screenshot shows me using the `--prefix` argument which results in the same response.

Sherman :
I have attached a screenshot of what is happening on my terminal.

Caplins :
Hi Marcus, 

Sorry for the shortened message. I am testing it for members who are not in rc and will present a solution shortly. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Caplins :
I notice the src directory has "rc" permissions.

Caplins :
Hi Marcus, 

I'm sorry to hear that the module isn't working. I just testing it out and I am able to load the module and create an environment.

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Leticia,

Sorry to hear that you are still continuing to have issues with the module. From what I've searched online, it seems to me that this might be related to the values of the input file that you are using, /scratch/adaogomes.l/gamess-test/Filatov-newgamess/test-lopez/mdapa-traj-17-lopez.inp

See: 
https://beowulf.beowulf.narkive.com/9Tc4CdEL/shared-memory-error
and
https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man2/semop.2.html#:~:text=EINVAL%20The%20semaphore%20set%20doesn,to%20allocate%20the%20undo%20structure.

As a test, could you do the following two?

1. Load the latest Gamess/2023R1-sockets module but use the input file from /scratch/adaogomes.l/gamess-test/files-fromDan/test.inp
to test whether there's an issue with the module itself of the file.

2. Change the parameter of mdapa-traj-17-lopez.inp, such as dt=5e-16 &/or nsteps=2000, and see if that makes a difference.

Not sure if that would make sense or not. I've personally never used the GAMESS software, so not sure how to guide you otherwise. After the installation, I had carried out the test that was mentioned in the installation README guide and that was successful, so I do not think this is an issue with software installation.

Hi Leticia,

Sorry to hear that. I'm not sure why that's happening to you when it runs fine for me for the same module and the same input file as yours. 

The error does point to a memory issue that you are running into. See https://stackoverflow.com/questions/32118545/munmap-chunk-invalid-pointer

I would need to discuss this further with the team and get back to you on this. In the meantime, make sure that your .bashrc is clean. 
See https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/first_steps/shellenvironment.html

Also, as a test, try to run this in an interactive mode using srun and see if you are getting into the same problem. So, just follow the instructions I had given in my last response to this ticket and see if your program is erroring out within 28 mins or less.

I ran a few tests for nearly an hour and didn't get this message. How much time after you submitted the job did you get that error message or was it pretty much right after the program had started running?

2. Land on an ib node, e.g.: srun --partition=short --constraint=ib --nodes=1 --ntasks=24 --time=01:00:00 --pty /bin/bash
I had compiled GAMESS on an 'ib' node and I didn't see --constrain=ib being used in your job.sh script

3. Load just the gamess module, it loads other required modules as well, no need to load gcc module separately: module load gamess/2023R1-sockets

4. Run rungms: 

rungms mdapa-traj-17.inp 00 24 &>  mdapa-traj-17.out (ensures that 24 processors on a single node are being used)

OR

rungms mdapa-traj-17.inp &>  mdapa-traj-17.out (most likely only using a single thread)

and see if you get the same error again.

Hi Joshi,
Thanks for your help with GAMESS!
I have submitted a tested job and it is now able to start the calculation with the new version of GAMESS. However, I received the following error message:

*** Error in `/shared/centos7/gamess/2023R1-sockets//gamess.00.x': munmap_chunk(): invalid pointer: 0x000000007d0b7150 ***

Here is the path for the job:

Hi Leticia,

I wanted to let you know that the 2023R1 version of GAMESS with non-MPI distributed option of sockets is now ready as a module on Discovery. Could you test it out by loading this module and let me know if it worked as expected:

module load gamess/2023R1-sockets

Hi Leticia,

Thanks for checking in. I'm still building it. I'm hoping that it would be done by tonight. I hope to update you by tomorrow morning if not before then.

Also, found out that with an MPI build, the main requirement is to adapt the rungms file. Are you familiar with the process of modifying the rungms file to ensure that the program is able to run successfully?

Since I need to submit some jobs as soon as possible, can you compile without MPI?
However, it would be good to have MPI in the future as it will speed up the computations.

Hi Leticia,

Thanks for providing the locations of your sbatch scripts. That certainly helped. So turns out that I will have to take a closer look into how the latest version was compiled using MPI. It seems to me that the current installation is not correct and the program, even though it runs, is crashing at the beginning itself.

You mentioned that you need the latest version of GAMESS as the method you are using is available in that version only. I wanted to know if that requires an MPI support or not. If not, then I can recompile the latest version pretty quickly for it to be available to you by tomorrow. However, if you do need MPI support, then that would have to wait as compiling with MPI is a bit tricky and will need more time from our side to ensure that it's done correctly.

@Caplins, Serena, if in case needed, see some installation notes on Notion for GAMESS. This software is a bit tricky to run and is picky about it rungms location etc. We can discuss this further, if need be.

Hello Dominique,

Thank you for booking a consultation with me, Here's a brief summary of our discussion. You had trouble with installing the  https://github.com/haqishen/SIIM-ISIC-Melanoma-Classification-1st-Place-Solution package inside of a conda environment. It turned out there were a lot of outdated dependencies and collisions between them. During the consultation, we were able to replicate the issue that you faced while installing the package, in specific the version of Pytorch used seemed outdated and any fix to the Pytorch version seemed to collide with the apex installation. After the consultation, I tried to get the package using conda entirely, but there seemed to be no luck there, The other options I can think of are using the latest Pytorch and libraries but rewriting the the deprecated API calls with the new ones. Please let me know if there are any updates from your side.

----------------------------------------
Description : My name is Vismay, and I am currently enrolled in the MPS Analytics program at Northeastern University, Vancouver. I am writing to request access to the Discovery Cluster, specifically its high-performance computing resources, to enhance my learning experience and conduct in-depth analysis for my integrated experiential learning classes.

I have a keen interest in exploring advanced analysis algorithms that are crucial for my coursework. The Discovery Cluster's combination of Intel E5-2680 v4 and Intel Xeon Platinum 8176 CPUs, coupled with NVIDIA GPUs (K80, P100, V100, and T4), provides the ideal environment for running complex computations and simulations. With over 20,000 CPU cores and 200 GPUs, I am confident that these resources will greatly assist me in developing and implementing high-performance algorithms for my studies.

Additionally, the high-speed data transfer capabilities through the 10 Gbps Ethernet and HDR100 InfiniBand interconnect, as well as the 3 PB of available storage on the GPFS parallel filesystem, will enable me to efficiently handle and analyze large datasets, a fundamental requirement for my integrated experiential learning classes.

I understand the responsibility that comes with accessing these resources and assure you of my commitment to adhering to all university policies and guidelines. I am dedicated to utilizing the Discovery Cluster responsibly for educational purposes and contributing positively to the university's research community.

I kindly request your assistance in granting me access to the Discovery Cluster, allowing me to fully engage with my integrated experiential learning classes and make the most of this invaluable opportunity. Please let me know if there are any specific steps or requirements, I need to fulfill to facilitate this access request.

Thank you very much for considering my request. I appreciate your time and attention to this matter. I look forward to the opportunity to utilize the Discovery Cluster's resources for my academic endeavors.

Respectfully,
Vismay Viradiya (he/him)

Caplins :
Hi Vismay, 

Are you currently enrolled in a course that is using Discovery? If so what is the course number? And if not, you can request access to discovery by filling out the form I sent you earlier (here it is again). You do need a faculty sponsor.  https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0ae24596db535fc075892f17d496199c

I just wondered if I misread you message the first time and you're enrolled in a course that is using Discovery. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Caplins :
Hi Vismay, 

Thank you for contacting RC with your request and for including such nice and helpful information. Our process of adding someone to the cluster is relatively straight forward and just requires you to fill out this form here: https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0ae24596db535fc075892f17d496199c

You will be asked to fill in a faculty sponsor which can be a professor who is teaching a course or one that you're doing research with. 

Hope that helps, 
Serena

CPU usage: 34%
You should not use the login node for CPU intensive activities, as this can impact the performance of this node for all cluster users.
Also, It will not give you the best performance for the tasks you are trying to do. Please reference our documentation for more information: Next steps<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/index.html>.

If you are trying to run a job, you should move to a compute node. You can do this interactively using the srun command or non-interactively using sbatch command. Please see our documentation on how to do this: Using sbatch<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/sbatch.html>; Using srun<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/srun.html>.

If you are trying to transfer data, we have a dedicated transfer node that you should use. Please see our documentation on transferring data for more information: Transferring Data<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html>.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, simply reply to this email or book a consultation with us using the link on our Consultation page<https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/>.

@Joshi, Manasvita Thanks for the update! I wasn't aware of the situation as I only took over the ticket today. I'll go ahead and close the ticket now.

m.joshi (Work notes) :
@DWADASI, PRASANTH, I had a consultation with the user on July 31 and walked them through the steps. Seems to me that they were able to conda install the software successfully.

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Rishabh,

Thanks for reaching out to us at RC. Apologies for the delay in our response.

a directory where users typically don't have write permissions. You can use these environments since everyone has execute access :

But you can create a new environment for yourself using conda with the following command:

conda create -n myenv

This will create a new environment in /home, where you have complete access. To check the existing environments along with their paths, use:

conda info -e

For installing and testing MindSpore, I followed these steps mentioned in the following link (https://github.com/mindspore-ai/mindspore):

1) conda create -n mindspore python=3.9
2) pip install -r requirements.txt. (You'll need to download requirements.txt from the GitHub repo)
3) Download the MindSpore .whl package from this link (https://www.mindspore.cn/versions/en)

   Use wget "https://ms-release.obs.cn-north-4.myhuaweicloud.com/2.0.0/MindSpore/unified/x86_64/mindspore-2.0.0-cp39-cp39-linux_x86_64.whl"

4) Install the MindSpore package using
   pip install mindspore-2.0.0-cp39-cp39-linux_x86_64.whl

5) Run some code from the GitHub repo to test the installation. It worked for me.

These steps are for the CPU version. If you need GPU support, you can follow the instructions here (https://gitee.com/mindspore/docs/blob/master/install/mindspore_gpu_install_pip_en.md).

Let us know if this helps or if you need further assistance.

Best,

I'm supposed to be running a Gaussian lab on Discovery through OOD for Chem 2162 next week. I tried to log in today, and was surprised to learn that I no longer know my password. At least, I suspect that's the problem. There wasn't an option on the OOD page to check my username or to reset my password. Can you tell me how that's done?

Description : Dear Discovery Team,

I hope you are doing well. I am currently working on the project involving differential RNA sequencing. However, I am facing difficulty with the alignment process as the coding specification I provided is not functioning as expected.The raw data that I need to process is approximately 2.9-3.1 Gb in size. The issue I am encountering is that alignment ends prematurely. I have been using the following coding specification
srun --partition=short --pty --export=ALL --nodes=2 --ntasks=10 --mem=100Gb --time=20:20:00 /bin/bash
 I would greatly appreciate your suggestions or solutions you can provide me to overcome the problem.

Looking forward to hearing back from you soon.

Thanks and regards,

Shenoy :
Hello Prachi,

Thank you for providing us with more details regarding your issue. From the screenshot you attached it seems like the process is ending pre maturely due to the time limit present for the process. I you think running the process for a few more hours will let it complete naturally the you can try the sbatch command with the following change "--time=23:59:00". With this the process will be allowed to run for a maximum of 24 hours.

If you do not think that the additional 3 hours will help you will have to split the alignment process into smaller batches or create a request for long partition (That way you can run your program for more than 24 hours) but it is recommended to split the workload into smaller batches.

Thank you,

* The process needed more than 20 hrs and 20 mins and hence terminated prematurely due to slurm ending the process. In this case the time parameter can be increased up-to 23:59:00.
* The process required more memory than what was provided and hence crashed. If this is the case you can try increasing the memory allocation.

Apart from this the process could have ended due to an error while the process was running. If you have the logs of the error, that might help as well.

If you run the job using "sbatch" instead of "srun" a slurm log file will be generated with the program output, this might be helpful when the user is not able to monitor the job while it is running.

Please do let me know if the above mentioned suggestions helped, if not you can share the log file of the job and the RC team can take a closer look.

Thank you,
Prajwal

4. If "exclusive" was not included, the cores may got assigned to different to different nodes, won't that cause unnecessary communication overhead?
I didn't quite follow this. You are requesting only 1 node, and 56 cores in that node. So the remaining cores are not being used by your program at all. How will that cause communication overhead? In fact, not utilizing the "--exclusive" flag will help your job "not" sit in the queue for long.

For this question, I would like to explain more:
As far as I know, the maximum number of cores in one Discovery node is 56, so I requested 56 to occupy the whole node and there is no idle core on the node being wasted.
If there is no "exclusive" tag, the cross node MPI communication will slow down the computation speed. Is that true?

m.joshi (Work notes) :
Thanks @Shomo, Greg, had forgot to check that when I had made the recommendation to include --constraint=ib

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Peiyuan,

The reason you are getting this new error is because with --constraint=ib, you got allotted a node with AMD chips while loading an intel binary through intel-oneapi/2021.1_u9. 

I didn't realize this when I had looked at your batch script the last time, my bad. Please change 
#SBATCH --constraint=ib 
to

 #SBATCH --constraint="ib&cascadelake" 
or even just 
#SBATCH --constraint=cascadelake 
since all our cascadelake Intel nodes are on Infiniband. 

I tested it out using:

srun --partition=short --constraint="ib&cascadelake" --time=00:10:00 --pty /bin/bash
[m.joshi@d0039 ~]$ module load intel-oneapi/2021.1_u9
[m.joshi@d0039 ~]$ source /shared/centos7/intel/oneapi/2021.1_u9-base/setvars.sh

and the module loaded fine.

Let me know if that helped.

Hi Peiyuan,

I took a look at /home/p.cui/bansil/tbg_dataset/dataset_bkp2/raw/443/tbg.err and the error "unable to run bstrap_proxy on d0018" means that you are getting some nodes without the infiniband fabric allotted to your job, which is causing this issue. 

See https://community.intel.com/t5/Intel-oneAPI-HPC-Toolkit/Intel-MPI-Unable-to-run-bstrap-proxy-error-setting-up-the/m-p/1204677

As I had shared the instructions in one of my previous replies, --constraint=zen2 flag was being used in the srun command to ensure that one is assigned a node with the ib feature enabled while installing and running the OpenMX software. Seems to me that that has not been incorporated in openmx_submit_script.pbs and that is causing issues based on what type of node is allocated to your job on the short partition. 

I would recommend you try adding the following to openmx_submit_script.pbs and see if that takes care of the issue:
#SBATCH --constraint=ib

Finally, how are you launching the sbatch script across multiple folders, do you have a mast bash script that launches the sbatch script across all folders? Are you utilizing Slurm's array job feature to help you out with launching multiple jobs at a time?

The OpenMX used was compiled according to your suggestion.

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Peiyuan,

Thanks for pointing me to the location of your scripts. I had found the submission script from one of the existing folders in that location. 

As for the node d0017, it is possible that at the time when you job was running on that node it experienced a momentary glitch that caused the network error. Sometimes that can happen to a node and MPI-based programs could suffer if they don't have checkpointing built in. This doesn't mean that there's an issue with your code. 

The only reason I was suggesting to ensure that you've followed all the necessary steps while installing OpenMX is because of the installation recommendations listed on their website that included taking care of the 'patch` file. It is better to take care of all the recommendations listed out by the developer while installing a software to avoid any unforeseen issues.

4. If "exclusive" was not included, the cores may got assigned to different to different nodes, won't that cause unnecessary communication overhead?
I didn't quite follow this. You are requesting only 1 node, and 56 cores in that node. So the remaining cores are not being used by your program at all. How will that cause communication overhead? In fact, not utilizing the "--exclusive" flag will help your job "not" sit in the queue for long. 

5. I don't think the problem can be solved because of my point 2, but I will try compile OpenMX with your method and use "mpirun" instead. BTW, could you kindly teach me why do you think "mpirun" is better than "mpiexec"?
This is really based on few tests that I had conducted sometime back while using Intel compilers and some documentation that I had seen for running MPI jobs with Intel compilers. All of them had used "mpirun" instead of "mpiexec", hence the suggestion. 

Let me know if that helped. If you face this issue with d0017 again or with any other node, please report to us so that we can take a look at that node more closely. Currently, from what our sys admins have told us, the d0017 node seems to be doing fine.

CUI :
First of all, Thanks for your attention to this issue, I really appreciate that.
I would like to say:
1. I do deleted that folder because I have to modify this folder for my research progress, you can still find the submission script from my other folder under  /home/p.cui/bansil/tbg_dataset/dataset/raw/
2. It is strange that node d0017 is doing Okay, because it is true that the job failed, and the error message clearly shows it's the node's problem.
If it is my OpenMX's problem, How to explain that other jobs not affected? let alone, if I submit again, the job will run successfully.

3. Thanks for your detailed instructions for compiling OpenMX.
4. If "exclusive" was not included, the cores may got assigned to different to different nodes, won't that cause unnecessary communication overhead?
5. I don't think the problem can be solved because of my point 2, but I will try compile OpenMX with your method and use "mpirun" instead. BTW, could you kindly teach me why do you think "mpirun" is better than "mpiexec"?

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Peiyuan,

I did discuss with the team and d0017 seems to be doing okay. 

I took a look at /home/p.cui/bansil/tbg_dataset/dataset/raw/71/openmx_submit_script.pbs. I could not find folder 73 in there, you may have deleted it. There are a few things I would like to clarify:

1. If you are requesting --ntasks-per-node=56 and --mem=100G, then there's no need for you to request the node in an exclusive mode using #SBATCH --exclusive as that might make your job sit in the queue longer and when it runs, it will have an entire node dedicated to your jobs when you are utilizing only a portion of it for your program. So it would be best to just remove #SBATCH --exclusive from your script.

2. I had installed OpenMX 3.9 last year and at the time it was also recommended to install a patch and copy that over to `source`. Did you do that for your local installation in /home/p.cui/Downloads/openmx/openmx3.9/source ? One can also install OpenMX 3.9 using Spack. Have you tried that as well?

3. I'm sharing the instructions I had followed to install version 3.9 and carry out a test to see if it installed successfully. Could you confirm that after doing that you are still running into issues? Also, I had used `mpirun` with intel compilers over `mpiexec`. It seems to work better. 

Feel free to book a consultation with me if you would like to discuss this further.

Hi Peiyuan,

What I was trying to suggest was that while we investigate the issue with d0017, you can include the --exclude=d0017 flag in your sbatch script. This would ensure that d0017 is not assigned to any of your jobs, which would help you run your programs without interruptions. 

I'll bring this issue up with our team and will keep you posted.

Dear Josi,
I am afraid it cannot be reproduced easily.
As I said, if I submit the job again, it may run normally. 
Maybe it is because it has been assigned to a different node.

Based on my observation, the failing rate was very high: I submitted 576 jobs, and more than 100 jobs failed for this reason. 
Then, I submit them again without modification to the job script. Everything is normal.
So, I guess it's some node's problem, please check carefully to avoid such issues happening.

Best regards,
Peiyuan

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Peiyuan,

Thanks for reaching out to RC regarding this and alerting us to the issue. We will start looking into what might be causing this on d0017. In the meantime, could you run a test for us? Add the following to your batch script that you are using to launch this program and let us know if it works every single time. Thanks.

Hello Larissa,


Thank you for scheduling a consultation with me yesterday. As we discussed your configurations look good to me but the bottleneck lies with Gephi itself. I believe using the latest Oracle Java along with memory and driver optimization should help you run Gephi to do preliminary network analysis. But unfortunately, there doesn't seem to be more we can do to increase the performance of Gephi on huge datasets. The solution here would be to switch to a different application. Please let me know if there's anything I can help with.

Doroshenko :
Hi Surya,

Unfortunately, I cannot change gephi configurations: when starting the program at first, I was getting errors that gephi cannot find java. Then after triple-checking the directory and configuration file, I copied your gephi.conf file to my etc folder and only changed my user name in the directory for Java.
Now I'm getting the following errors  in gephi.conf file
line 18:unexpected EOF while looking for matching `"'
line 22: syntax error: unexpected end of file
and I do not have my original gephi.conf file anymore because I replaced it.
Help!

Periaswamy :
Hello Larissa,

Please let me know if you run into any issues.

Periaswamy :
Hello Larissa,
 
Thank you for booking a consultation with me today.
I was able to get the Oracle version of Java installed, and to my surprise, it did make a big difference. I was able to run the range filters and rendering which was not possible before. I have outlined the steps to set up memory and Oracle JDK below. 
Download Oracle JDK tar to your home folder 
$ cd $HOME
$ wget https://download.oracle.com/java/17/latest/jdk-17_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz
Extract the downloaded JDK. 
$ tar -xzf jdk-17_linux-x64_bin.tar.gz
Once you have that setup it is as simple as changing the config file to point to the Oracle Java
Open gephi.conf file located in /etc of the Gephi app folder with your favorite text editor 
Change the jdkhome="/home/l.doroshenko/jdk-17.0.8/"
To set the memory simply append the "-J-Xmx256g" argument to the end of the default_options string in gephi.conf located in /etc of the Gephi app folder.
I have attached a copy of my config file for your reference, Please change my username to your username. With this, you should have Oracle JDK and memory fixed, below I have mentioned a couple of pointers that could prove to be useful while running Gephi:

Enable the frame rate monitoring option under Tools > Options > Gephi > OpenGL > Show FPS, This shows you how many frames you are getting in the window. (The higher the better)
While you are present in the Tools menu also set Antialiasing to 0X (Tools > Options > Gephi > OpenGL > Antialiasing).
Make sure to change all your fonts to Monospaced fonts and reduce the size to as small as possible. This does seem to have a marginal performance improvement. 
Ensure that proper graphics driver support is installed 
Open a terminal and run $ glxgears
This should open a window with gears spinning
If the frame rate for the gear window is greater than 500 or so, you should be set
I did try requesting a better CPU setup but the performance in that situation was worse than the regular OOD setup. Maybe because the X11 forwarding is far worse than just using a VNC. 

I hope these instructions prove useful. Please reach out to me if you face any issues.

Thank you,

Surya

Doroshenko :
Thank you for this follow-up, Surya!
Over the weekend I have also recalled that Gephi also allows changes to memory allocation for large graphs: https://github.com/gephi/gephi/wiki/Troubleshooting
It looks like I need sudo access to implement some of these changes. I've scheduled a consultation, so we can discuss that and also how to start on multiple GPU testing. The instructions I received were not clear to me and I am stuck.
Larissa

Periaswamy :
Hello Larissa,

I was investigating this issue with the sys admins, and turn out that there's more to Gephi than what meets the eye. Gephi seems to use OpenGL as a driver to utilize GPUs. The discovery cluster is cuda friendly and there aren't many applications that use OpenGL for rendering on the cluster.  Hence OpenGL-based applications are extremely slow since they don't have the proper driver to utilize the full computing power of the GPUs on the cluster. The fix here would be to get the proper drivers installed to utilize the full computing power of the cluster. I am working on that installation. I will get back to you with you more updates once this goes through.

Thank you,

Surya

Periaswamy :
Hello Larissa,

Great ! I will see you at 3:30PM today.

Thank you,
Surya

Doroshenko :
Thank you for the updates, Surya! It's good to know that CPU and memory are not the source of slow work, and agree with your assessment that it might be GPU. As I mentioned, choosing a short partition for the task did not work as well as choosing one GPU. I've scheduled the follow-up consultation for 3:30 pm tomorrow.

Periaswamy :
Hello Larissa,


Thank you for booking a consultation with me yesterday. Here's a brief summary of our discussion:
You had trouble with using Gephi with over 6 Million nodes and 1 million edges. You were requesting a job with 12 CPU cores and 128 GB Memory with a v100-sxm2 GPU.
Still, you had trouble rendering the nodes on the OOD XFCE Desktop app.

I went through multiple jobs which you have requested in the past couple of days:

[s.periaswamy@login-00 ~]$ seff $jobid

Job ID: 38115200

Cluster: discovery

User/Group: l.doroshenko/users

State: CANCELLED (exit code 0)

Nodes: 1

Cores per node: 12

CPU Utilized: 18:45:30

CPU Efficiency: 35.04% of 2-05:32:12 core-walltime

Job Wall-clock time: 04:27:41

Memory Utilized: 33.00 GB

Memory Efficiency: 25.78% of 128.00 GB

I think that the CPU & Memory utilization is normal and you can even get by requesting fewer resources. But I believe the bottleneck might be with the GPU. It's hard for me to get the GPU utilization without you having an active job running, Hence I would prefer if you could book another consultation to figure out if GPU is actually the bottleneck here:https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/

If GPU turns out to be the bottleneck you can speed up your workflow by putting in a partition access request for Multi-GPU, Please go through our documentation here for more information: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/hardware/partitions.html

Surya

Students will have to close out of any open connection to Discovery and sign back in because unix groups are assigned at log in.  On Open OnDemand, you may have to open up the Developer menu and select Restart Web Server which will update the student's unix groups.

Thank you,

Joseph

Description : Hello,



I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to bring to your attention an issue I have encountered while trying to access the EAI6010 course on the odd.discovery.neu portal.



I can successfully log in to the portal using my credentials; however, once logged in, I am unable to find the EAI6010 course in the list of available courses. It seems that the course is missing or not accessible from my account.

Could you please advise me on the appropriate steps to take or if there is any additional information you require from my end to address this issue? Your guidance in this matter would be immensely helpful in ensuring that I can participate fully in the EAI6010 course.

Description : Hello,

I was wondering if you could help me with an issue that I am having with the memory for my jobs. Normally, I can run jobs with up to 50Gbs of memory allocated, and they run normally. However, recently when I run jobs it gives me an error at random stating that it cannot allocate memory and the job dies. I can re-run it without changing anything and it runs perfectly. This happens in both Gaussian and Molcas, so I do not think that it is program specific. Furthermore, jobs that only request 7Gbs provide the same error. Please let me know if there is anything that can be done.

@Caplins, Serena downloading in parallel via sbatch will be frustrating, as all compute nodes use the same gateway (effectively nullifying the parallelism). it should still work, but it will not be faster (and may be slower) than 1 machine downloading all-those-files. kinda depends on their size. lmk if you want to talk through this.

Hello Xiangyu, 

Thank you for reaching out to RC. I was going through some of the methods to download citypspace dataset and found that you can download dataset in parts

wget --keep-session-cookies --save-cookies=cookies.txt --post-data 'username=myusername&password=mypassword&submit=Login' https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/login/

In this below code, you can replace packageID and download all the files of the data set

wget --load-cookies cookies.txt --content-disposition https://www.cityscapes-dataset.com/file-handling/?packageID=1

The packageID are mapped in following manner on the website
 
1 -> gtFine_trainvaltest.zip (241MB)
2 -> gtCoarse.zip (1.3GB)
3 -> leftImg8bit_trainvaltest.zip (11GB)
4 -> leftImg8bit_trainextra.zip (44GB)
8 -> camera_trainvaltest.zip (2MB)
9 -> camera_trainextra.zip (8MB)
10 -> vehicle_trainvaltest.zip (2MB)
11 -> vehicle_trainextra.zip (7MB)
12 -> leftImg8bit_demoVideo.zip (6.6GB)

Description : Hi ITS,

I would like to thank you for your help for fixing c4035 under hung’s partition online last time. The sad news was it went down right after I ran a couple works. It looks like this node is unstable and very fragile. Could you please help me to bring it back online? I guess something needs to be fixed to make it more stable.

Thank you in advance!

Description : Hello RC Team,

I recently noticed that my Globus and OOD accounts are set up with two different Northeastern users. I have a student and a staff account. I am hoping to switch my OOD account to my student user. How should I proceed?

Thanks,
Alaina

Shenoy :
Hi Alaina,

I did check and I can see that OOD and Globus accounts are associated with martens.ala. I could not find any account associated with a.martens.
Do let me know if there is any issue with accessing both Globus and OOD using the username martens.ala and I can help you out to figure things out.

Thanks,
Prajwal

I could not find either of the accounts on discovery. Let me take a deeper look as to whats going on and get back to you.
I apologize for the late reply.

Hi,

I believe my globus account is associated with my staff email: a.martens@northeastern.edu<mailto:a.martens@northeastern.edu> and OOD is associated with my student: martens.ala@northeastern.edu<mailto:martens.ala@northeastern.edu>

Hello Qingchu,

Ensure that you have installed the widget library (ipympl) in the same environment where you are running Jupyter Notebook. You mentioned that you installed it in your virtual environment, but make sure you activated the environment where you installed it before launching Jupyter Notebook.

conda activate your_virtual_environment
conda install ipympl

Dear m.ondrechen,

We have noticed that you're running CPU-intensive processes on one of the login nodes(login-01), as detailed below.

CPU usage: 40%
You should not use the login node for CPU intensive activities, as this can impact the performance of this node for all cluster users.
Also, It will not give you the best performance for the tasks you are trying to do. Please reference our documentation for more information: Next steps<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/index.html>.

If you are trying to run a job, you should move to a compute node. You can do this interactively using the srun command or non-interactively using sbatch command. Please see our documentation on how to do this: Using sbatch<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/sbatch.html>; Using srun<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/srun.html>.

If you are trying to transfer data, we have a dedicated transfer node that you should use. Please see our documentation on transferring data for more information: Transferring Data<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html>.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, simply reply to this email or book a consultation with us using the link on our Consultation page<https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/>.

Hi Joseph,

Cooke :
Hello Huiyu,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. The memory limits for the GPUs depend on the GPUs that you request. We have that documented in our documentation found here (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/workingwithgpu.html). 

The memory that you set with --mem=10G is the amount of CPU memory that you are requesting. There isn't a flag to pass to allocate GPU memory and you get all of the memory the GPU has for your job.  For example, from the srun command you shared, you are requesting a v100-sxm2 which from our table in the documentation I shared, has 32 GB of memory.

Does that answer your question and do you have any other questions?

Thank you,

Joseph

Huang :
The command I started with is: srun --partition=gpu --nodes=1 --gres=gpu:v100-sxm2:1 --cpus-per-task=2 --mem=10GB --time=02:00:00 --pty /bin/bash. I am not sure if my question is related to gpu name. If so, what are main gpu I can use and their memory limits?

Hello Samsun,

It looks like the .Xauthority file in your home directory is somehow modified to have only read permissions. Generally, the file has both read & write permissions. We believe this might have caused the issue. Is it alright if I move the .Xauthority file to .Xauthority.old so that a new. Xauthority with the right permissions gets generated?

reply from: b.post@northeastern.edu

Hi, can you explain what you mean by read only and read write groups? Does that mean that if someone is in a read only group, all of the folders in my /postresearch directory are read only to them, and if someone is in the latter group, they can edit any folder or file? If so, that does not work b/c of 2, below.

Regarding question two, that is exactly correct. There is a set of raw data stored on the cluster that can absolutely not be modified by anybody except for me. Expen$$ive data so it’s essential to keep that protected even from well-intended research assistants.

Regarding 3, thanks for clarifying, yes, that is ideal.

Hello Brady,

We needed a few clarifications regarding your setup:

1. Providing user-level permission can be a painful task so we were wondering we could streamline the process by creating read-only and read-write groups for your setup and just add the users to those groups. 

2. Also, we noticed that once a new user is onboarded to your group, READ-ONLY access needs to be granted to the Data_raw directory and READ-WRITE access is granted to the directory which is created for a particular user. Is our understanding of the required setup correct?

3. Also,  can all group members have access to each other's directories? 

Thanks,
Paarthvi

RITM Update: reply from: zh.liao@northeastern.edu

Hi Greg, thank you for helping out this issue. The 10 T storage will be very helpful. The issue I was facing is related to data file uploading/transferring. I was trying to upload the data file larger than 10G and it was rejected due to the limits. But it seemed that I should use Globus. Thank you for the suggestion from Serena. Zhenyu

Liao :
RITM Update: reply from: zh.liao@northeastern.edu

Dear Serena,

You are right on the spot. Yes, that's what I am facing on OOD. I was trying to upload the data file on ODD for analysis. But it is larger than 10G limit per upload file. Thanks for directing me to this web. I have not got this step now but just wanted to check if you once I put my data file on Globus then set up the links using the following step. I should be able to find the data files on ODD. Thank you again for the help. Zhenyu
To transfer files from Discovery to your personal computer, do the following

  1.  Create an endpoint on your computer using the procedure above "Install Globus Connect," if you have not done so already.
  2.  In the File Manager on the Globus web app, in the Collections textbox, type Northeastern, then in the collection list, click the northeastern#discovery endpoint.
  3.  click Transfer or Sync to in the right-pane menu.
  4.  Click in the Search text box, and then click the name of your endpoint on the Your Collections tab. You can now see the list of your files on Discovery on the left and on your personal computer on the right.
  5.  Select the file or files from the right-side list of Discovery files that you want to transfer to your personal computer.
  6.  Select the destination folder from the left-side list of the files on your computer.
  7.  (Optional) Click Transfer & Sync Options and select the transfer options you need.
  8.  Click Start.

Caplins :
Hi Zhenyu,

Are you needing assistance with file transfer? 

For files larger than 10GBs we recommend using globus. You can see our documentation on getting that set up here. https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/datamanagement/globus.html

You can also arrange a consultation if you'd like more direct assistance. https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/

Cheers,

I think the "limit" for file transfer on the OOD files app is 10G (I thought I read that somewhere recently) but we don't have it in our documentation.....might be what the user is asking about here.

The maximum space is 10G, which substantially smaller than the data file I am using (36G). I am wondering if you could help expand the data file capacity so that I could upload that dataset online.
PS. I wanted to say thank you for the great work that team has been done for research computing. This makes data processing work much easier. Joseph has provided lots of guidance during this process. This is extremely helpful. I am very grateful.

PS. I wanted to say thank you for the great work that team has been done for research computing. This makes data processing work much easier. Joseph has provided lots of guidance during this process. This is extremely helpful. I am very grateful.

CPU usage: 40%
You should not use the login node for CPU intensive activities, as this can impact the performance of this node for all cluster users.
Also, It will not give you the best performance for the tasks you are trying to do. Please reference our documentation for more information: Next steps<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/index.html>.

If you are trying to run a job, you should move to a compute node. You can do this interactively using the srun command or non-interactively using sbatch command. Please see our documentation on how to do this: Using sbatch<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/sbatch.html>; Using srun<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/srun.html>.

If you are trying to transfer data, we have a dedicated transfer node that you should use. Please see our documentation on transferring data for more information: Transferring Data<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html>.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, simply reply to this email or book a consultation with us using the link on our Consultation page<https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/>.

Hi Emma,

Thank you for reaching out to RC with your request.

It looks like you have used 10 nthreads to run the script. Have you tried using more number of threads? If not, could you please run a few test runs with nthreads =10, 20, 40, 80? Please match the ntasks in the sbatch script to the number of threads in the program. The program looks like it is configured to run on as many as you give it (there is likely a threshold where it is optimized).

Thanks,

Description : Hello,

I am writing to inquire about good methods to benchmark real MPI applications on Discovery (not microbenchmarks).

I notice that, on Discovery, runtimes often fall within one second for the same trials, but sometimes there is a weird outlier. For instance, consider the following string of runtimes:

sw4
[88.14, 88.38, 88.59]
Median: 88.38
Sigma: 0.22516660498395533

sw4_openmpi
[87.85, 88.06, 89.6]
Median: 88.06
Sigma: 0.9555277773740174

sw4_mana_mpich_vids
[112.19, 112.46, 113.65]
Median: 112.46
Sigma: 0.7768097150096294

sw4_mana_openmpi_vids
[135.22, 136.5, 142.35]
Median: 136.5
Sigma: 3.8012673325265234

sw4_mana_mpich
[101.21, 101.61, 102.8]
Median: 101.61
Sigma: 0.8270630769979609

Observe that in each class, the runtimes are consistently within one second, except with sw4_mana_openmpi_vids.

How can I make the testing environment as deterministic as possible? Currently, I'm running with sbatch files that look like:


#!/bin/bash
#SBATCH --job-name=sw4_run          # Set the job name
#SBATCH --output=sw4_%j.out         # Set the output file name (%j expands to jobId)
#SBATCH -N 1                        # 1 nodes
#SBATCH --ntasks=56                  # Request 56 tasks
#SBATCH --time=01:00:00             # Request 1 hour runtime
#SBATCH --exclusive
#SBATCH --constraint=cascadelake

Hello Leonid,

Slurm is configured with physical hardware so that node has 56 cpu cores which is why sinfo is reporting that. Hyperthreaded cores are virtual cores so they are not accounted for in the configuration.

Good catch on that but it is matching what the system is actually.

Do you have any other questions that I can assist with?

Thank you,

Joseph

Belyaev :
reply from: belyaev.l@northeastern.edu

When I run sinfo -N -r -l​, it appears that the d0084​ node is listed as having 56 CPUs. This appears to be a mistake, as I have just shown that it has 112 in actuality since it has hyperthreading enabled.

Best,
Leonid

Hello Joseph,

You're right to think that the nodes within the same architecture class could be different.
I poked around in d0084​ versus d0075​, d0090​. Here is the output of diff slow_node_cpu fast_node_cpu​ :

4,6c4,6

25d26

So, it appears that d0084​ has:

  1.  Hyperthreading enabled, while the others do not
  2.  A fixed 2.2Ghz clock rate, while the others have a clock rate of up to 4 Ghz.

When I run fixed to d0084​, the output is consistently slow. So this is the cause.

Thanks!

Cooke :
Hello Leonid,

I started looking at the jobids you gave me and I pulled the nodes those jobs were run on:

38314738 :
38314739 :
38314740 :

For your statistics and benchmarking, are you only running 3 tests per case? Also are they identical cases or different initializations for the same script? 

Did you have other jobs that ran on node d0084 and were the runtimes any different? 

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Leonid,

Locking it down to a particular architecture will get you the same CPU architecture. There shouldn't be anything significantly different between the nodes of the same architecture with respect to run time. I was asking more to get the nodes that you were running on and if you noticed the slowness on a particular node, etc. 

You can request specific nodes in the sbatch script but that may make your queue time increase just because you will have to wait until that node becomes available. I will take a look at the job ids and see if anything jumps out in terms of something that might make the runtime slower.

Thank you,

Joseph

Belyaev :
reply from: belyaev.l@northeastern.edu

Joseph,

You write that even though I'm locking the allocations down to a specific architecture, I may still be getting meaningfully different nodes? Is that the case?

If so, how can I make sure that the computational environment is completely equivalent in my sbatch file?

I have the following job ids to investigate:

38314738, 38314739, 38314740
Corresponding to the runtimes:
[32.99, 40.76, 32.16].

As you can see, the middle runtime is /substantially/ slower, but without it the runtimes are very close. This is a typical pattern.

The input given is the script I showed you.

Best,
Leonid

Cooke :
Hello Leonid,

I am just reaching out to see if you have any other questions.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Leonid,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing and apologies on the delayed response. 

Do you have the job IDs for the benchmarks that you have completed that we can look into and see the nodes they were running on? I would first look and see what nodes the jobs ran on. I see in your script that you are locking it down to a specific architecture and you are requesting exclusive access to that node but you might be getting different nodes that might cause a little runtime difference. It shouldn't cause a significant difference though but it would be the first place I would check.

Are you doing the benchmarking work for part of a project or publication? Ideally, you would want to run the benchmarks on the same node to ensure it is the same each time and you are only observing fluctuations in the runtime execution of the program. 

Are you only testing MPI on a single node or are you planning to scale up to multi node runs? Is it the same exact input script in each run but do they have different initializations for each run?

Thank you,

Joseph

if you google "northeastern sponsored account", 
you will find the web-page for this (if it looks like
2005 or so, that's the correct web-site). 

the link i get looks like

RITM Update: Thanks so much! 5TB is ok for now, I will request more once we reach the limit. Please add the following student users to my group: Shijin Duan <duan.s@northeastern.edu>, Tong Zhou <zhou.tong1@northeastern.edu>, Nuntipat Narkthong <narkthong.n@northeastern.edu>, Ziyu Liu <liu.ziyu4@northeastern.edu>

Shomo :
RITM Update: hello xaolin-

thank you for reaching out to RC !

we noticed that you did not have an account
on the cluster, so we've just created on for you.

additionally, we've also created a unix group
to manage access to your space, which is also
now created.

do you require all 35T immediately ? if not, we
prefer to allocate space in chunks of 5TiB. updating
the quota is literally updating a single integer, so 
this should not take long. 

please let us know who else should have
access to your space and we will add them in.

thank you

Description : Hello,

I would like some help and information on using the Express partition. Will the Express partition help my jobs finish faster? For example, I have a job that takes about an hour to complete on the GPU partition with the following settings: #SBATCH --partition=gpu, #SBATCH --time=8:00:00, #SBATCH --nodes=1, #SBATCH --mem=300GB, #SBATCH --gres=gpu:1. Will using the Express partition cut this time down to 5-10 minutes? Do you need additional settings like the -gres=gpu:1? Please let me know.

Thanks,

Cooke :
Hello Michael,

I am going to resolve this ticket since we haven't heard back from you. If you have any other questions please reach out to Research Computing at the following links: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/welcome/gettinghelp.html

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Michael,

I am just reaching out to see if you had any follow up questions.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Michael,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. The express partition is a cpu only partition with a shorter default and maximum runtime set for it than the short partition. You can see the information about all the shared partitions in Discovery here: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/hardware/partitions.html

So for the express partition, the default time is 30 minutes and the maximum time is 1 hour. It doesn't run jobs faster than other partitions but it is meant for shorter run time jobs than what can run on the short partition.

Do you have any other questions that I can assist with?

Thank you,

Joseph

Hi Prasanth,

Thank you for the suggestions! I will try headless mode.

Best,
Xupeng

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Xupeng,

Unfortunately x11 is no longer supported in sbatch. However, there are a few alternative solutions that may help you to run your simulations.

1. OnDemand Desktop: We have an Xfce Desktop available on Open OnDemand (https://ood.discovery.neu.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/desktop/session_contexts/new) which utilizes VNC instead of X11 for GUI operations. This might be a viable solution if you need to use a GUI for running your simulations and could potentially be faster.

2. Headless Mode: If CoppeliaSim (or any other simulation software you are using) provides a "headless" mode, it will allow the simulations to run without requiring a graphical interface. This mode is specifically designed for situations like this, where rendering graphics is unnecessary or impractical.

3. Virtual Framebuffer (Xvfb): Xvfb is an in-memory display server for Unix-like systems that performs all graphical operations in memory rather than producing any visible output. It's useful for running applications that technically require a display but don't actually need to display anything. This may allow you to use your applications in our environment without X11 support. 

   Please note that while we currently don't have Xvfb pre-installed on our servers, you may want to check if it's available in the Docker container you're using or consider including it in your container.

4. Refactoring the Code: If your applications don't need the graphical interface to function, another solution is to refactor your code to separate the computation and the rendering. This would allow you to perform the computation on the server (without requiring a graphical interface), and then perform the rendering on a local machine that does have a graphical interface.

I've found an article (https://forum.coppeliarobotics.com/viewtopic.php?t=8291) where a user was able to run CoppeliaSim in headless mode using Xvfb. Although we currently do not have Xvfb installed on our servers, it's worth checking whether it's available in your container.

Please do not hesitate to let us know if you need further assistance in working through these options or if you have any other questions.

Best,
Prasanth

Zhu :
Hi Prasanth,

Thanks for the quick response.  The reason for using x11 is I am running a simulator that needs rendering. I have successfully ran the simulator (CoppeliaSim) with srun-x11 asigned gpu nodes. Now I am trying to run multiple runs by sbtach. Do you have any idea to run it?

Best,
Xupeng

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Xupeng,

Thanks for reaching out to RC.

Typically, X11 forwarding is used for running graphical user interface (GUI) applications, which seems unusual for a non-interactive batch job. Upon reviewing your scripts, we noticed that your batch job is executing a container which runs a Python code.

Could you please provide more details on why you need X11 forwarding in this context? Understanding your requirements will help us to provide a more appropriate solution or potentially suggest an alternate approach that might be more suitable for your use case.

We appreciate your cooperation and look forward to your response.

Best regards,
Prasanth

Hello Sara,

Thank you for contacting RC with your query.
A lab drive is usually located in /work/<directory name> and is owned by a unix group. Members of the unix group can access the directory. If Saeed is part of the unix group, the directory should be accessible to them.

Data can be moved in and out of the directories in multiple ways. I am mentioning two methods int he following links
https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html
https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/globus.html

If the data set is large and cannot be broken down into multiple parts I would recommend using globus as a failure during transfer in SFTP/SCP may cause data corruption.

I hope this helps, let me know if I can help you with anything else.

Thank you,

Hello Bingyu,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. The error message you are getting is because your $HOME quota is over the set quota. You $HOME disk usage is currently at 96 G and the quota is at 75 G and this will prevent you from opening up OOD applications such as JupyterLab Notebook.

And he checks that he only has about 500kb storage used at /home/jiabe.chen directory. Also, he can’t access the login.discovery.neu.edu<http://login.discovery.neu.edu/> using the VSCode at local via ssh. But previously he can use both the above ways to get access to the server to use VSCode.

Could you help to check the issue and fix it? Thanks a lot! Your timely reply would be more than appreciated.

Description : I installed a third-party software, PRISMS-PF, using a Singularity container. However, when I tried to run the PRISMS-PF code across two nodes, each with multiple threads, I didn’t receive the expected output. When I ran it on one node using 48 cores, it worked well. However, an issue was encountered when attempting to run it on two nodes, with 48 cores per node; the operation stalled without producing any output.

Please include my PI, Professor Alain Karma, in the loop. His email is a.karma@northeastern.edu.

Cooke :
Hello Jiefu,

Thank you for letting me know that the zen 2 architecture will work for your current benchmarking of the code. We agree that in the future it would be beneficial to have containers that can utilize multiple nodes and it is something on the roadmap for the future. We have have a few other things that are in front of it but I did bring this up to the team yesterday. 

You are welcome for the assistance and I am happy that I could help.

Do you have any other questions or can I resolve this ticket?

Thank you,

Joseph

Tian :
Hi Joseph,

There are no specific constraints on the architecture or the number of nodes I wish to use. My main requirement is to determine the performance benchmark, so the only constraint would be to stay within the same CPU architecture/spec, if possible, and to have multiple cores accessible. 

I have reached out to the primary developer of the application I am benchmarking. The application should in principle be able to operate on multiple nodes. However, you're right. Many factors could potentially affect the outcome, and I don't have control over the build method with the Singularity container currently. Though it would be beneficial to resolve the multi-node issue, I believe proceeding with up to 128 Zen2 cores should address my concern for now.
Thank you so much for your assistance.

Best,
Jiefu

Cooke :
Hello Jiefu,

Running MPI with containers can be difficult across multiple nodes and it usually can depend on multiple factors including how the container was built and with what version of MPI and the versions of MPI on the cluster itself.  Does the job itself require more than 1 node or require you to run on the Cascadelake architecture? We have nodes that have more cores than 48 that you can request if those two are not constraints for you. The Zen2 architecture on the cluster have 128 cores so if it is just trying to scale the jobs up with more cores this might be an alternative to try and see how the job runs using those resources.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Jiefu,

Hi Joumana,

You are correct that all the professors I mentioned are US based. I think it would be best to reach out to them directly and see if they will be willing to take you as an online researcher for their group. 

We don't have much visibility into their decision making process since we are supporting the high performance computing cluster for the entire university and interact with these professors or their group members only through tickets or consultations.

I'll go ahead and close this ticket now. Feel free to reach out as in when required for issues related to the Discovery cluster.

Thank you for your response.
Each professor mentioned in your email works at the Boston campus or elsewhere in the US. Correct me if I'm wrong, please. As a research assistant, Can I still contact them while residing in Toronto? I am interested in securing online sponsorship. I previously requested Prof. Sara Arunagiri, as she is offering online support. I'm looking forward to her replying to my email soon. Due to the flexibility of online engagement, I am open to continuing my research remotely. Your guidance and advice would be greatly appreciated. Kindly let me know if there is any alternative for Toronto students.

Hi Joumana,

Thanks for your email. I just posted your response here so that all our correspondence is in one place. 

As far as knowing few faculty members in the area of DS is concerned, I would suggest reaching out to Mikhail Oet and Xiaomu Zhou for it in CPS. 

Then you can also reach out to Shawn Bhimani, Anand Venkateswaran, or Raymond Fu to see if their research aligns with yours and if they have any openings. Talking to other faculty members in your department would also help.

Hope that helped.

Periaswamy :
Hello Sreesatya Janaki,

I want to express my appreciation for scheduling a consultation with me yesterday. During our discussion, we delved into the sctransfer package and its current status. Regrettably, this package is considerably outdated and no longer receives active maintenance. Consequently, many of the API calls to its library functions have been deprecated.

It's important to note that the installation of the sctransfer package will only function correctly within a separate conda environment that does not have base R installed. This is due to potential conflicts with version requirements for sctransfer when R is present.

I understand that you were able to find a solution using RStudio Cloud, as we discussed. In light of this, I will be closing this ticket now. However, please don't hesitate to initiate a new ticket if you encounter any further issues or require additional assistance.

Best regards,
Surya

Periaswamy :
Hello Sreesatya Janaki,


The package seems to have a lot of dependency collisions between the base R package part of the conda. Please schedule a consultation in the upcoming week to go through this issue in further detail.


Thank you,
Surya

Periaswamy :
Hello Sreesatya Janaki,


Thank you for scheduling a consultation with me on Monday. I have been working on the installation of the package and I was able to get it installed today. Please note that while importing the CSV data I am still running into errors such as :


"ERROR: The Python ssl extension was not compiled. Missing the OpenSSL lib?"


To my understanding, devtools seems to be installed properly. But this error is because of the Python installation which is required for saverX. I believe using a singularity container would be the best route here since we need to install and manage a couple of OS-level dependencies.  I have attached the R.yml file. Please use this to create your own copy of the conda environment with R.


$ conda env create -f R.yml


Once I have the singularity container created I will update this ticket.

Hi surya,

Ya it sounds like good idea, we can processed with it, thanks.

Periaswamy :
Hello Sreesatya Janaki,

We can build a custom conda environment with the packages you require(saverX, R, etc) and export it to a yml file. You should be able to recreate the environment using the YML file.
If that sound good please let me know and I can get started with the installation.

Periaswamy :
Hello Sreesatya Janaki,


I think I might have a solution for your issue. I think installing R in your conda environment and using the saverX package from the conda env could resolve this GLIBC issue. The issue seems to be because of using a conda environment with RStudio. Please let me know if you require help with getting R installed in your conda environment.


Thank you,
Surya

Hi Surya,

Yes, I tried installing the GCC compiler suite it did do any better, I will try with other flavors of R , please find the error screenshot. Thanks for the suggestion.

Thanks,
Satya.

Periaswamy :
Hello Sreesatya Janaki,


Sure, please share a screenshot of the issue you are facing. Also, the errors look like missing some of the GCC compilers. Have you installed the GCC compiler suite packages for R? Another suggestion would be to try utilizing the different flavors of R studio such as tidyverse and, geospatial as they do ship with a couple of essential libraries

Hi, Surya

Thanks for reaching out, yes, I successfully installed saverx package in Rstudio, but while I am running the package to do some data processing, it is throwing me some errors. Like GLIBCXX_3.4.29 package not found. I am wondering if I could show this issue in RStudio you may give me some suggestions to fix this.

Thanks,
Satya.

Periaswamy :
Hello Sreesatya Janaki,


Thank you for booking a consultation with me. here is a brief summary of our discussion:
https://github.com/jingshuw/SAVERX :
During the consultation you told me that you were accessing R from the terminal, I suggested using the RStudio environment available as an OOD Application here: https://ood.discovery.neu.edu/
After the consultation, you reached out to me saying that you were able to successfully install the SaverX package using Conda.

Please let me know if you are still having trouble with the installation.

I am going to resolve this ticket since we have added you to the Gaussian group and you have access to Discovery. If you have any other questions please reach out to Research Computing at the following links: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/welcome/gettinghelp.html

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Dan,

I just added you to the Gaussian group so you have access again. It takes 2 hours for the changes to take effect and you may have to select restart web server under the open on demand developer menu at the top when you sign in for the changes to appear. 

Please let me know when you try it and it works and if you have any other questions.

Thank you,

Joseph

Hi Joseph,

I just logged into OOD successfully. However, it seems I have lost access to the Gaussian group. Could I please be added back into the Gaussian group so that I can access GaussView?

Best,
Dan

Donnelly :
reply from: donnelly.dani@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

Yes, I am part of those courses. The courses are:
CHEM3432 11935
CHEM3432 15318
CHEM3402 13457

Thank you,
Dan

Cooke :
Hello Dan,

Thank you for letting me know who your sponsor should be and it is for TAing purposes. Are you part of the course you are TAing on Canvas? 

Thank you,

Joseph

Donnelly :
reply from: donnelly.dani@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

My access will still be for TAing purposes. To the best of my knowledge, my sponsor should have been (and still should be) Brian D'Amico of the chemistry department. Brian is my supervisor for my TAing duties.

Best,
Dan

Cooke :
Hello Daniel,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. Who was your sponsor for your Discovery account while you were TAing and had access? Is this still for TAing or is this for research purposes?

Thank you,

Joseph

Shomo :
user's account was reaped back in may ?!? guess we'll have to see who their sponsor is, etc.

Description : hello,

I was trying to install some stuff on my home directory and in that process, I accidentally deleted my bashrc file and I am not able to see my username on the login node. In my recent sessions with manasvita joshi ma'am, I told her about this issue, and she moved one bashrc file to my home directory, we tried to source it but it was not working.

m.joshi (Work notes) :
Thanks for the note @Periaswamy, Surya

Periaswamy :
@Joshi, Manasvita, @Caplins, Serena, Asking the users to run the following command, fixes this issue:

1. cp /etc/skel/.bashrc ~
2. cp /etc/skel/.bash_profile ~

Periaswamy :
Hello Hrithik,

That's great! I will be closing this ticket now, feel free to open a new ticket if you face any issues.

Please let me know if there are any updates on this ticket.

Thank you,

Periaswamy :
Hello Hrithik,

Can you also copy the .bash_profile file from skel? $ cp /etc/skel/.bash_profile ~

Best,
Surya

Kanoje :
reply from: kanoje.h@northeastern.edu

Nope, this didn't work.

Periaswamy :
Hello Hrithik,

I think the permissions on your .bashrc file have changed which might be the reason for running into these issues. Can you try the following and let me know if it resolves your issue or not :

$ cp /etc/skel/.bashrc  ~

This copies over a .bashrc file from skel, which has all the default set of configurations.

Thank you,
Surya

Kanoje :
reply from: kanoje.h@northeastern.edu

so when I am on my login node I can not see my name instead I only see bash-4.2 . when I move to compute node I can see my name. how do I get my name back on the login node? I am attaching both screenshots.

Periaswamy :
Hello Hrithik,

I looked into your .bashrc and everything looks fine to me. What's exactly the issue you are facing ?

Thank you,
Surya

Periaswamy :
Hello Hrithik,

Thank you for reaching out to RC. I am investigating your issue, I will get back to you with updates.

Description : Hi all! I was just wondering if there's any issues going on with Discovery today? I'm attempting to sync my experiment data with WandB like I usually do and have been doing for weeks, but today all of a sudden I'm getting timeout and port-related errors when it's attempting to sync. I was just wondering if this would be Discovery-related? I had no issues yesterday for instance.

Thanks,
CK

Wijesundara :
reply from: wijesundara.c@northeastern.edu

Hi Joe! Appreciate the detailed followup, it turned out that it was just a temporary issue, it fixed itself within a few hours.

Thanks,
CK

Robinson :
Greetings CK:

Are you logged into weights and biases? Also, I assume this is on a compute node?

I am able to log using wandb. Can you try again today?

Also, what are you logging? Is it light (e.g., text metadata) or more images and videos? If the latter, consider logging offline and syncing every so often. This should be no problem for the cluster, but I stumbled into this issue mentioned on their GitHub (i.e., asking if they are using the latest and greatest version, if not, consider upgrading), https://community.wandb.ai/t/getting-connecttimeout-in-offline-mode-when-trying-to-log-an-image/3844/2

First things, first: try again to see if it was just not working in the moment and is better now.

Best regards,
Joe

Feel free to resolve this ticket.

Hi Marcus, 

No you can reject it. Their account exists.

Sherman :
Thank you. Would rejecting the request mess up any of their functionality?

Caplins :
Hi Marcus, 

The student has an account already and is added to the unix group for BINF6310. Perhaps they thought they needed to submit a separate request? The are enrolled in the class correct?

No need to do anything with the request. We wont act on it without your approval and since they already have an account there is nothing to do but perhaps reach out and check if they can access discovery? (just a suggestion).

Cheers, 
Serena

should be all set. 

please note that if you are using OOD, you will have

hello mackenzie && thank you for reaching out to RC ! 

as all RC systems are unix-based, we usually avoid having
spaces in directory names. would you prefer something like

GrovesCreekOmics

or something else entirely ? let me know and i'll get that setup
for you.

thank you

Description : Hi --

I'm writing to request a Northeastern account for Matthew Kollmer (cc'd), a
student at the University of Illinois who is collaborating on a research
project with our lab. We would like him to have access to our data on the
discovery cluster and so he needs a Northeastern account.

Best,
David

Sharma :
Hello David,

Please let me know if there are any further queries regarding this issue.

Thanks,
Paarthvi

Sharma :
Hello David,

1. To get the sponsored Northeastern account for Matthew , the request needs to be created with ITS rather than Research Computing. I am sharing the documentation on how this can be done:
https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0013989&sys_kb_id=a80e8d6397eb695066d1b83e6253af09&spa=1

2. The next step would be to Enroll in Duo Two Factor Authentication :
https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=kb_article_view&sysparm_article=KB0012649&sys_kb_id=79a6298e8741615409aa0fe9cebb35e8&spa=1

3. After you have completed the steps above, log into ServiceNow using your sponsored account credentials, and submit the following to request your Discovery account:
https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=sc_cat_item&table=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0ae24596db535fc075892f17d496199c

Thanks,

Hi Eugenia,

Thanks for reaching out to RC.
We've added you to the long partition. This change will take effect within 2-3 hours, and you can start running jobs once you're able to see the "long" group when typing the command:
$ groups

To run jobs on the long partition, use the Slurm flag --partition=long

Description : Hello Emma,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing and booking a General Consultation with us. Below is a summary of the topics that we discussed in the consultation:
1. You shared that you are using the HALFpipe container on Discovery and you are receiving and error message about the FreeSurfer license file.
2. I shared that I pulled a copy of the container to (/shared/container_repository/halfpipe/halfpipe-halfpipe-latest.sif) for general usage also.
3. We worked through some debugging steps to see if the license file was visible in the container by echoing the variable after we 'exec' into the container.
4. We determined the container could see the license and we verified that we could run FreeSurfer in the container. 
5. I asked if you could copy a data set to your /scratch directory for me to do additional testing on to determine what we need to do to get it to work.

If you have any other questions, please reach out in this ticket.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Emma,

Thank you for letting me know that the script fixed the previous errors. From the error log that you have attached, it looks like there are python functions that are causing the errors in the container. That would be more in the developers field to debug more easily.

Do you have any other questions that I can help with or can I resolve this ticket? 

Thank you,

Joseph

Tinney :
reply from: tinney.e@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

Yes, the script fixed the previous errors! This error is no longer coming up but we are getting other errors. I think this is due to halfpipe, not the cluster. Since you are not super familiar with it, we reached out to someone on their team. Hopefully they can help out!

Cooke :
Hello Emma,

I am just reaching out to see if you were able to try this again to see if this cleared up the error message.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Emma,

I just looked and my output file had it run everything successfully. Did you just copy my script directly? The uuid that your initial script had and the one that I generated from your data set was different. That might be something that is generated when you follow the halfpipe steps and it creates the slurm scripts. Could you check and see if your uuid from your initial script would work or if you want rerun the pipeline to generate the script, and just add in the last line about the license file.

Let me know if that works.

Thank you,

Joseph

Tinney :
reply from: tinney.e@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

It was running and reading the freesurfer license but now we are getting another error. Were you able to run it with no errors?
I attached the log file for you to check out. The error we got was: “Exception: Could not find graphs for "4bc62efa"”. That ID is the uuid, not a participant ID.

Let me know if you have any suggestions.

Thanks again,
Emma

Cooke :
Hello Emma,

I did some testing over the weekend and found out that there is a flag that we can pass into the Halfpipe program to specify the license path for FreeSurfer. Here is the script that I used and it ran successfully. 


#!/bin/bash

#SBATCH --job-name=halfpipe
#SBATCH --output=halfpipe.log.txt

#SBATCH --time=1-0
#SBATCH --ntasks=1
#SBATCH --cpus-per-task=2
#SBATCH --mem=9216M

#SBATCH --array=1-4

if ! [ -x "$(command -v singularity)" ]; then
module load singularity
module load freesurfer/7.2.0
source $FREESURFER_HOME/SetUpFreeSurfer.sh
export SINGULARITYENV_FS_LICENSE=$FREESURFER_HOME/license.txt
fi

singularity run \
--contain --cleanenv \
--bind /:/ext \
/shared/container_repository/halfpipe/halfpipe-halfpipe-latest.sif \
--workdir /ext/scratch/j.cooke/harmonize/working_dir \
--only-run \
--uuid 4bc62efa \
--subject-list /ext/scratch/j.cooke/harmonize/working_dir/subject-list.txt \
--subject-chunks \
--only-chunk-index ${SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID} \
--nipype-n-procs 2 \
--keep some \
--fs-license-file /shared/centos7/freesurfer/7.2.0/license.txt

I added back in the 

--contain --cleanenv \ 

because that didn't solve the initial problem of it not seeing the license and the container might really perform better with that line.

I did change the following two lines though,

--keep some \
--fs-license-file /shared/centos7/freesurfer/7.2.0/license.txt

with adding the back slash so it reads onto the next line and I passed it the '--fs-license-file' flag with the path to the license file. It ran after this.

If you could try and make these adjustments and let me know if you are able to run the script then.

Thank you,

Joseph

Hi Aanchan, 

We have your course and Jupyter app set up and ready to go. You will find the course directory here:

/courses/CS6140.202410/

Which has three sub-directories:

/data /staff /students

The /data folder is read-write-executable by those in staff (yourself and any TAs or co-instructors). And is read only for students.

The overall storage limit for CS6140.202410 is 1 TB and can be increased if need by (just let us know). 

The Jupyter app is alive on the OOD under "Courses" 

Let me know if you have any questions,

Hi Aanchan, 

Just reaching out to you again. I see in the past we have used a jupyterlab notebook for your course with a conda environment with all of the packages you requested.  Would that same set up work for you again this semester?

Cheers, 
Serena

Caplins :
Hi Aanchan,

Thank you for submitting your classroom request. I wanted to ask if you need an application to accompany your classroom request?

For example I can install the packages you listed in a conda environment which you can access via a Jupyterlab app, which would be accessible on the Open On Demand app under 'courses'. Would that be sufficient for your needs?

We typically ask for a few days to 1 week to complete classroom requests, but I will try and have things set up for you by the end of this week.
Many thanks,

I'd like to enable root login for myself and students/faculty I work with (small number) and be able to connect from our machines. Ideally with as fast network access as our infrastructure can support.

All help appreciated,

Cheers

Ian

hello ian-

is it OK if we resolve this ticket and start
a new thread after you've had a couple of
days to work on discovery ? 

just checking in, etc
&& happy computing !

Gorton :
I've applied for a RC account so hopefully that will work great. :

Assigning for research for customer reach out.

Shomo :
i'll take a stab at this and see if RC can help.

Shomo :
hello ian-

i work over in research computing and wonder if there is something
we can do in RC that helps you out here. do you require physical access
to the machine or just access via ssh, etc ?  what architecture(s) do you 
plan to test ? 

my schedule is pretty terrible tomorrow (thursday), but i should have 
time on friday to see if RC can help here. please let me know if you are
interested.

happy computing !

Gibbons :
Ian is looking to host a server on the Seattle Campus. Is there a way we can secure a machine on campus (he's willing to host it physically in his office which remains locked when he's not using it) and provide a static IP? Would they be able to remote into the machine from outside of the NU network?

Description : Hello RC Team,

Our lab uses Discovery and Globus for data management. We worked with a member of your team to set up a Globus collection that leads to our data set in /work_encrypted in Discovery. However, this was set up such that one of our former lab members, Morgan Hatfield, was the owner of the collection.  Morgan has now left the lab and we would like to transfer ownership of the Globus collection to another lab member, Alaina Martens. Our understanding is that the best way to do this is to create new collection under Alaina's name, and delete the old one. Alaina created a new collection and tried to link it to the ZimmermanLab directory in /work_encrypted, however she received an error saying that she didn't have permission to complete this action. She is able to access the data through our old Globus collection as well as through Open on Demand, so we're wondering if you know what is preventing Alaina from linking the collection to our data, and how we can resolve this.

Thank you,

Great, I’m free after 2:15 tomorrow or 9-10am on Thursday.

Robinson :
Alaina:

This needs to be done in Globus. We are unsure if it can be done, as you might have to create a new collection and point it to the data (remove the old metadata). Let's do this in consultation!

Are there times tomorrow afternoon, Thursday morning to early afternoon, Friday (most times), or next Monday (most times)?

Best regards,
Joe

Martens :
reply from: martens.ala@northeastern.edu

I can access the group!

A previous lab member, Morgan Hatfield, is the “owner” of our data, so we would still like to change ownership to my account. Is this possible?

Robinson :
Greetings Hannah:

What is the status here? It appears you are in the group, so I am uncertain why you cannot access it.

Can you try again? If it doesn't work, can you try to access `/projects/zimmermanlab/` via command line or OOD?

Best regards,
Joe

m.joshi (Work notes) :
@Robinson, Joe, not sure why they are not being able to. Can you ask them to try to access `/projects/zimmermanlab/` directly from the terminal or via OOD?

Robinson :
@Joshi, Manasvita, I checked the `groups.xtra` and the user is listed as a member of zimmermanlab. Do you know why this would be?

Martens :
reply from: martens.ala@northeastern.edu

Hi,

Sorry for the delay – I was having difficulty getting access to our lab’s directories on OOD. I now have access and am trying to change ownership/create a new collection for our lab’s data on Globus. I got most of the way through creating a new collection, but then received an error about not having permission (screenshot attached).

Robinson :
Greetings:

How is it going?

Robinson :
Greetings Alaina:

You should now be the owner of the ticket.

How goes the problem?

Best regards,

Caller :
reply from: a.martens@northeastern.edu

Hello RC Team,

Hannah has transitioned out of her role in the lab, so I’m following up on the incident below. I just had a call with RC help and they said that you should be able to change the ownership on your end – would that be possible?

Thanks,
Alaina

m.joshi (Work notes) :
@Robinson, Joe, I believe the person needs to be an administrator to transfer the ownership. This might be a @Shomo, Greg thing but not sure.

Robinson :
Greetings Hannah:

This might be better to do via consultation. Nonetheless, perhaps we could find a simple solution. Does this contain the info you need, https://docs.globus.org/globus-connect-server/v5/reference/collection/set_owner_string/

Joe

Description : Hi Serena,

I am starting a new position at the Roux working with scRNAseq data and I am trying to familiarize myself with the Seurat tool. However when I try to install it I get this error

[cid:d209c714-80cd-4665-af13-ad4b7d157828]

It seems like this libglpk.so.40 file is the issue. Documentation online recommends sudo installing the libglpk-dev compiler but since I dont have those permissions I thought I would reach out to you.

Any help would be greatly appreciated.

I was using the tidyverse flavor and attempting to install from github,

Thank you so much for your help. 

Best,

Griffin

Cooke :
Hello Griffin,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing and sorry for the late response to your inquiry.  What flavor of RStudio are you using from the OOD menu? I just tried to: 

install.packages("Seurat")

inside of the 'Geospatial' flavor of the RStudio of OOD and it was able to install that package. The different flavors have different system and R packages installed natively with Geospatial having the most additional packages. When I run into that error message I normally try it in the Geospatial flavor just because of the additional packages.

Could you try it and see if it works for you and your workflow? 

Thank you,

Joseph

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Ayan,

The issue you're facing is due to an incompatible version of the GCC (GNU Compiler Collection) with PyTorch. The warning indicates that your GCC version, which is 4.8.5, may not be compatible with PyTorch. PyTorch recommends using a compiler that is ABI-compatible with GCC 5.0 or higher.

The error message 'gcc: error: unrecognized command line option ‘-std=c++14’' suggests that the C++14 standard is not recognized by your current GCC version, which again points to an outdated version of GCC.

Try loading the latest version of GCC we have 

module load gcc/11.1.0

Please also consider the fact that sometimes such environments require more resources than are available, like memory or disk space, which can cause similar issues. Make sure that you're not running out of these resources.

Let us know if this helps

Description : Hello Team,

I'm exploring an Interactive App "WEKA" which I would like to demo to the class tomorrow. Two questions:


  1.  I cannot find the datasets WEKA usually installs with its desktop version. These usually have an extension of "*.arff". I looked up but couldn't find. There are a few in exotic locations like /home/vladisha/.local/lib/python3.7/site-packages/scipy/io/arff, but I don't believe this is where they should have been.
  2.  When I treid to "Open URL" option with the dataset that successfully opens in Chrome browser on my host machine, it fails, see the screenshot below. I tried with either "http:", or "https:".

Thank you, Joshi. I submitted RITM4325051 to setup a class. I'm curious to see how it's going to work.

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Vladimir,

Yes, any classroom computer would have access to the class shared folder. In fact, your students will be able to access the shared folder through OOD itself.

Shapiro :
Hi Joshi, what I meant was that ANY classroom computer could get access to the shared storage. Just like any of them has access to OOD, which makes it convenient. Storage and OOD should go hand in hand; it's like the data and the compute.

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Vladimir,

In that case, could you initiate a classroom request with us right away? See https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/classroom/class_use.html

As mentioned before, you can indicate to the person who would get in touch with you regarding the classroom request that you are interested in setting up a shared folder for the class on the cluster.

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Vladimir,

So I had a conversation with our sys admin, Greg Shomo, and turns out that hooking up NU OneDrive to OOD is not an option. The OOD server is just a web interface for running jobs on the cluster without having to go through a terminal. So nothing's really hooked onto the server. Additionally, none of our compute nodes have network access to OneDrive at the moment, so connecting OneDrive to any of the compute nodes would not be possible either. 

Let me know if getting a shared folder for your class would work out for you or not, given that we will not be able to get you setup with OneDrive and OOD. Were you able to initiate a classroom request for your course? Sorry, haven't had a chance to skim through all tickets as I was out.

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Vladimir,

I'm received your software installation request. Thanks for initiating that with us. The task has been assigned to very capable hands. 

As for setting up a shared folder for your class, typically we ask the instructors to raise a classroom request ticket with us where you would be asked to attach a class list and indicate any software you might want to use along with setting an OOD app exclusively for your class. See https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/classroom/class_use.html

You can indicate to the person who would get in touch with you regarding the classroom request that you are interested in setting up a shared folder for the class on the cluster.

I'm not sure if it is possible for us to integrate NU OneDrive to OOD. That's a good point and I can update the ticket with this information later.

Best,
Manasvita Joshi, Ph.D.

Shapiro :
Joshi,

1. I filled up the software update request. Was it possible to make the installation by myself?

2. Could you please answer:
 a) I don't have a shared folder. How can I set up one? 
 b) Also, is it possible to mount the Northeastern OneDrive to ODD? This would help sharing the data easier.
 
Once I get the WEKA thing resolved, I'll check the KNIME. Please disregard for a moment.

Thank you,
Vladimir

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Vladimir,

The "Access Denied" is due to the fact that you need to register for our training course. Please register using https://northeastern.instructure.com/enroll/LNNCHN 

and you should be all set.

Sure, we can update WEKA to its latest version. Could you please initiate a software installation request with us for this for our records? See 

https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=777c510bdbebd340a37cd206ca9619b0

As for KNIME, not sure I followed your question completely but we do have 2 versions of KNIME on OOD that is accessible on all compute nodes.

Hi Joshi,

Thank you.

1. Getting "Access Denied" on https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/126767/pages/ml-platforms-on-discovery?module_item_id=8954500

I don't have a shared folder. How can I set up one? Also, is it possible to mount the Northeastern OneDrive to ODD? This would help sharing the data easier.

2. Got it.

Updating WEKA version would be desirable. 

Question: is the status of KNIME all on ODD the same?

Best,
Vladimir

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Vladimir,

Thanks for reaching out to RC regarding this. As for your questions:

1. WEKA datasets are installed in our /shared location since it was installed as a module prior to turning it into an OOD app. See the training module that was recently put together by RC for exploring WEKA on OOD: 

https://northeastern.instructure.com/courses/126767/pages/ml-platforms-on-discovery?module_item_id=8954500 

But long story short, you will have to copy the WEKA data folder located at /shared/centos7/weka/weka-3-8-4/data over to your $HOME or a shared location for your class on Discovery, so that your students can access it from there. The  /shared/centos7/weka/weka-3-8-4/data is not a writeable location, so trying to access the date directly from there and updating it on WEKA would not work.

Do you have a shared folder for your class on Discovery?

2. The reason the "Open URL" option didn't work is because all compute nodes on Discovery are shielded from the outside work and are not on public network. This is by design, so the access has to be local.

You might be the first person to test out WEKA since it was put on OOD. Please test it out and give us your feedback on improving this further. The current version of WEKA on OOD is 3 years old though. Would you want to get this updated?

RITM Update: reply from: zeiberg.d@northeastern.edu

The code is not able to be checkpointed in an efficient manner. I am already breaking up the work into multiple smaller jobs, but the smaller the jobs I submit the more work I am duplicating and the more compute time I will require to run all my experiments. By running these jobs on the long partition I will be able to reduce my overall cluster usage.

Sharma :
Hello Daniel,

Do we have an update regarding this?

Hello Daniel,

Thanks,
Paarthvi

Sharma :
Hello Daniel,

Thanks for reaching out to RC with your request!

Have you tried checkpointing the code? Does that give any issues?
The idea behind checkpointing is to be able to run multiple shorter jobs rather than submitting a single long job. It is usually done by saving the latest calculation stage into a checkpoint file, so the next job can load it and continue from the latest stage of the run. This prevents you from losing your data in case a job crashes and allows to monitor and analyze your data frequently. Additionally, it allows to avoid partition time limits.

Over the weekend, I ran a script on Jupyter notebook using Discovery's interactive session, and the last line of the script wrote some data to a CSV file. I didn't specify a local path, so I am wondering if it is possible to retrieve that file somehow?

Thanks,

Caplins :
Hi Melissa, 

Was this in an srun session on the command line or on the OOD app? If the former it should have been output where it was executed. If it was the OOD it should be in your working directory (defaults to /home/username if you left that field blank). 

If you prefer to use the OOD you can look for it in the Files app (left most tab on the dashboard).

Description : Hi,

I hope all is well! I am currently trying to train a machine learning model that requires GPUs. I tried training it with the current time limit (8 hrs) in the gpu partition but needed more time to finish training. Can you help me create a code that will check point the progress to work within the timelimit of the gpu partition?

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Christian,

In order to obtain access to the multigpu partition, you would need to initiate an access request with us. 

See https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/hardware/partitions.html#partition-access-request

It is a 2-stage process. In the 1st stage you can run some small iterations of the test to show how well your code is scaling with the use of more GPUs. One can request multigpu access to run programs longer than 8 hours. In that case, you can justify your need by showing that the program cannot be checkpointed and would take longer than 8 hours to finish.  

Hope that helped. Feel free to book a consultation with us if you would like to discuss this further or need clarification on the process.

Hello Manasvita,

Thanks,
Christian

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Christian,

Thanks for sending me the location of your scripts and apologies for a tardy response. Are you still looking to checkpoint your code?

I took a look at some of your scripts and also discussed your case with our ML Performance Engineer, Joe Robinson. We collectively feel that it would be best if you were to book a consultation with us using https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/

The PyRAI2MD software has an extensive nested structure of multiple codes and it would be best to discuss the overall methodology of creating, training, and saving the model before checkpointing is applied.  Of course, TensorFlow, which is required for training purposes comes with its own checkpointing options that can be leveraged here. See https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/checkpoint

But there are multiple other packages that are being used and it would be good to get an understanding of how they are playing a role to best leverage checkpointing. 

Finally, I couldn't understand how you are getting TF >= 2.2, as in how and where that has been installed. 

Hope this was helpful. Feel free to book a consultation with either me or Joe (cc'ed here) based on your availability in the next few days if you are still looking for assistance.

Hi Manasvita,

I am using my lab’s code, PyRAI2MD, for the job but I think that it uses TensorFlow to train the model. Its location is ‘/scratch/salguero.c/tweety-2/ml_tweety/e2n2_trial/’. I am launching it with the script that is in that folder named ‘run_pyrai2md.sh,’ which is essentially a sbatch script. I hope that helps, please let me know if there is any other information needed.

Thanks,
Christian

Description : Hi There,

I have a couple jobs that I have submitted which have been in the queue for about a day now. Is there a way I can specify in my sbatch file what node I want to run my program on to avoid the long queue times? If so, where can I see what nodes are in use and which are free?


I'm in Armen Stepanyants' group.

Hello Junaid,

I hope the query you had was resolved, if not please let me know so we can help you better.

Best,
Keval

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Junaid,

In addition to what Keval mentioned, one thing to keep in mind is that if you request a specific node then it is going to take even longer for you to get that node because the scheduler will be able to assign it to you only when the specific node has all the resources available for your request.

Are you still facing this issue? If yes, could you share your batch script that you are using to request resources. Sometimes, more than the node it is the combination of resources (memory, cpus, time, etc) that you are requesting that keeps your job in the queue for long.

Additionally, you can run the following command to inform you of the resources that are available to various nodes on the short partition. Sometimes that could help to modify your sbatch script.

sinfo -p short --Format=time,nodes,statecompact,features,memory,cpus,nodelist

Hello,

All the nodes in shared partition (short, debug, express) are shared by all the users of the cluster. So it is not possible to land on specific nodes unless they are reserved. You may have to wait for the nodes to get assigned to you. Please let me know if you need any further information

Caplins :
Hi Priyanka, 

It may take a while as you're asking for the whole node. If it's possible to run your analyses with fewer resources it will run faster, but if not I'm afraid you will have to wait. It's difficult to predict how long it will take as it all depends on the other jobs that are running or in the queue. However, the priority for your jobs gets higher the longer it waits.....so eventually it will be the first to run. 

I'm going to go ahead and close this ticket as the original issue seems resolved. Feel free to contact us again if you run into any other issue. 

Cheers,

Hi Priyanka, 

Can you try to reset the webserver? You can do this by going to the "Develop" tab on the right-hand side of the OOD dashboard and selecting "reset webserver". And then try relaunching Matlab. 

Does that fix the issue?

Hello Walid,
 
I am reaching out in reference to INC11824785, Sonali has requested a directory in your /home directory (/home/w.saba/data/promed_data ) on Discovery be copied to /work/nlp for work they are working on. I messaged you on the ticket a couple of times but just wanted to reach out via email to ask for confirmation if this is okay or it is not okay to copy the directory to /work/nlp. You can respond either to the ticket or to the email.
 
Thank you,

Cooke :
Hello Saba,

I am just reaching out to see if it is alright if we copy the directory `/home/w.saba/data/promed_data` into /work/nlp for Sonali to have access to it for work?

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Kenneth,

Thank you for your permission. As soon as we hear from Saba, I will copy the directory over.

Thank you,

Joseph

Church :
reply from: k.church@northeastern.edu

fine by me

Cooke :
Hello Sonali,

No problem and you are welcome. I have attached Kenneth and Saba to the ticket for confirmation on the copy is okay to complete since the directories are in Saba's home space and Kenneth is the owner the /work/nlp.

Hello Kenneth and Saba, 

There has been a request to copy the following directory (/home/w.saba/data/promed_data) to /work/nlp so Sonali has access to it for work. I just need to get everyone's approval and I can copy the directory over. Also is there a good location within /work/nlp for the directory to be copied to?

Thank you,

Joseph

Bandi :
Hello Joseph,

Thanks for your help. I do have access to the /work/NLP directory. This should be fine.

Cooke :
Hello Sonali,

Both yourself and Saba have access to /work/NLP which is owned by Kenneth Church. So if everyone is okay with it, we can copy that directory from Saba's /home into /work/NLP to a location that everyone is comfortable with. I can also attach both Saba and Kenneth to the ticket so we can get confirmation from everyone on this copy.

Thank you,

Joseph

Bandi :
We do not have any such common / work directory can you please check if you can add me to the NLP group of Church, Kenneth so that I can have the similar access as they have. As in Church, Kenneth can access Saba, Walid files and vice versa. Let me know once this is done.

Bandi :
Hello Joseph,

I have spoken about this with Church, Kenneth part of the NLP group and he did mention to get access to w.saba (Saba, Walid) files.
Can you please check on this and let me know. There is a mail attachment of Kenneth already approving this as well. Let me attach it for you.

Shomo :
@Cooke, Joseph prolly best to move that data to /work/nlp

Cooke :
Hello Sonali,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. The permission denied error you received is because you are trying to access a file that is in someone's /home directory. If this is for a group's research work, it should be stored in a common /work directory for all members to have access to it. 

Could the owner of the file copy/move it over to the NLP work directory so it can be accessible? 

Thank you,

Joseph

Thank you,

Cooke :
Hello Qing, 

I have attached a tarred up directory that have the files required for the installation. I am going to post the instructions and the directory setup here as well. 

The tarred directory has the following files:

[j.cooke@login-00 VASP_VTST_install_files]$ tree -L 1 -a
.
├── env_vasp.bash
├── install_vasp.bash
├── main.F
├── makefile
├── makefile.include
└── .objects

0 directories, 6 files

which all are required for the installation. The main.F files is from the VASP source directory but two lines had to be updated in order to use the VTST package. The makefile also had to be updated to compile the updated package along with the makefile.include. the .objects file is a hidden file that had to be updated to container the .o files that come for the software compilation. 

You will need to copy the files into your directory for the installation as such:

[j.cooke@login-00 vasp.6.3.1]$ tree -L 1 -a
.
├── arch
├── bin
├── build
├── env_vasp.bash
├── install_vasp.bash
├── main.F
├── makefile
├── makefile.include
├── .objects
├── POTCAR
├── README.md
├── slurm-38436909.out
├── src
├── testsuite
├── VASP_VTST_install_files
├── VASP_VTST_install_files.tar.gz
└── vtstcode6.3

which is similar to the directory setup that you shared in /work/qzhao-neu/vasp.6.3.1-vtst. The install_vasp.bash files will cp these files into place and build VASP with VTST then.

You will have to update the two paths in env_vasp.bash:

export SOFTWARE_DIR=/work/rc/j.cooke/VASP-VTST/vasp.6.3.1
export SOFTWARE_BUILD_PATH=/work/rc/j.cooke/VASP-VTST/vasp.6.3.1/build

to point to the directory that you would like the build to occur like previously. I have them just pointing to my directory where I did the test build to make sure everything built properly. 

If you want to make backup copies of .objects and main.F which are both in the src/ directory because this installation script overwrites them so VTST can be built in VASP.

Please let me know if you have any questions and if something doesn't build properly. I don't have any test files to run VASP on to test it with the VTST package but it builds without any errors.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Qing,

Thank you for reaching out. I just finished up the compilation of the VASP with VTST and now I am working on finalizing the installation scripts for you. It shouldn't take too much longer.

Thank you,

Joseph

Description : Hi,

I was trying to use the command mri_synthstrip<https://surfer.nmr.mgh.harvard.edu/docs/synthstrip/> on the cluster, which should be under update of freesurfer that is currently on the cluster (7.2). However I did not see it under the shared folder /shared/centos7/freesurfer/7.2.0/bin/

Would you be able to update it so that way we can use the mri_synthstrip command? I attached the link for your reference.

Thanks!

I am trying to load the login page for Discovery right now - and the login page is not loading.

When it does load though - when I try to login - it gives me a bad resource error.
I have tried clearing my cache to fix that and that hasn't helped either.

Speaking to my team members, I realize that Discovery is not down. Furthermore, I tried checking my internet connection and everything else seems to be loading fine.
While I am on a personal network, I also tried connecting to the Global Protect VPN and repeating this whole process, to no avail.

Kindly guide me as to what I can do.

Got it, thanks for the clarification Greg! I've gone ahead and modified my sponsored account and my sponsor has approved.

RITM Update: reply from: g.shomo@northeastern.edu

hello alex-

the "right answer" here is to go back to your
sponsored account and modify it such that
"University Email Account Required" is "Yes".

most of our systems require an email address
(for notification purposes like system downtime,
etc). this is relatively new (about 6 months olde
now), but fixing that up would be great !

let me know if you want some company while
you set that up and we'll figure something out.

i hope that helps !

Hi Keval,

I am getting an error message when I try to login to access the Discovery cluster. Here is the message:

"Login error: ldap: entry "uid=ale.harris,ou=facultyandstaff,dc=neu,dc=edu" missing following required attribute(s): ["mail"]"

I also can't setup an appointment for a consultation since I do not have a Northeastern email address (I'm a sponsored account).

Can you guide me with next steps?

Thanks,
Alex

Hello,

Is there availability for next week? I don't think I will be able to run the code today.

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Benjamin,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing.

Upon examining your request, we see that you've requested 12 GPUs for testing. The aim of Multi-GPU testing is to ascertain the scalability of your code with an increase in the number of GPUs. Post this testing phase, you would typically raise a post-testing ticket providing your efficiency scores, based on which we could grant you access to the Multi-GPU partition.

For the moment, we propose to allocate a single node with 4 A100 GPUs for your testing needs, allowing you to evaluate your code on this setup.

We have availability for testing on a node tomorrow (July 14) at 12:00 pm noon.

Could you kindly let us know if this time is suitable for you, so that we can accordingly reserve the node for your use?

Best Regards,
Prasanth

Description : Hello,

I wanted to know the proper procedure on downloading a large (we estimate between 1 to 1.5 Tb) data volume which is found on HuggingFace, and can be imported via the datasets library or cloned via git. I found many details on data transfer to and from local machines and the HPC via the transfer node but was not clear on if it is acceptable to use a direct download to our /work folder (RiffusionXL), or if it's recommended to download it ourselves and transfer via Globus. We have already requested and received storage space for this, but I was not clear on the best methodology here.

I have seen the Data Transfer Consultation form, but as we do not currently have the dataset downloaded locally, it was not clear what the source destination would be, or if the form is even appropriate in this scenario.

Thank you for your time and assistance,
Chase Kenyon

Caplins :
Great to hear! Thank you for letting me know!

Kenyon :
Hello Serena,

That seems to have worked well, thank you, this should be resolved now!

Chase

Caplins :
Hi Chase, 

Globus would be the preferred method if possible for this sized dataset. However, I imagine it will take quite a while to try and download 1TB locally before transferring it to Discovery. And that kind of local transfer is best avoided (for time and space). 

So it would probably be best to transfer this using datasets library on the transfer node xfer. You can ssh onto the xfer node, go to the directory in RiffusionXL where the data will live, activate a conda or virtual python environment where you have the datasets library installed and download the data there.  Then exit the transfer node. 

Let me know how that works for you. 

Cheers, 
Serena

hello wang.dian-

please do not compile on the login nodes.
the login nodes are scarce resources shared
by all users of the cluster and compiling
directly on them does affect everyone using
the cluster.

please submit an interactive job, eg

srun --pty -N1 -n8 /bin/bash

and compile on a compute node.

due to heavy load on the login server, i have
had to kill off your earlier compilation.
apologies for that, but i hope you understand.

thank you

Description : Hi,

I’m teaching two sections of CS 4530 this Fall, and would like to create a new GitHub “organization" neu-cs4530-fall2023 that is associated with Northeastern’s Enterprise account, so that my students will be able to use GitHub actions.

My colleague Jon Bell tells me that you handled a similar request when he taught the same class last year.  Can you tell me what I should do to make this happen?  Should I create the organization and let you know its name so that it can be upgraded/associated with the NU enterprise account, or is there a different process?

best regards,

                -Frank

Hi Paige, 

It looks like you already have an account on discovery with the username asbury.p (your password is your same northeastern.edu password).

You can access stata on the discovery cluster via the Open OnDemand app: https://ood.discovery.neu.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/

Once you log in you can find the stata app in the pull-down menu for "interactive apps".

We have some documentation on using the OOD, though our documentation doesn't at this time include using stata.. https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-ood/introduction.html#using-ood

Hopefully the app on Open OnDemand is what you're looking for!

Hello Jake,

Thanks for reaching out to RC with your request!

To access Discovery, you must first have an account which needs to be approved by a sponsor. In this case your sponsor can be a professor or researcher who you will be working with. Here's the documentation on how to get access : https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/first_steps/get_access.html

Please discuss with your sponsor and open a ServiceNow request with us by filling the form : https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0ae24596db535fc075892f17d496199c

Once your account is created you will be given the Discovery user ID using which you will be able to access the cluster.

Let me know if there are any further queries regarding this issue.

Thanks,
Paarthvi

Description : Hello Jing-ke, Kathleen, and Matthew,

Thank you for booking a General Consultation with Research Computing on 07/11/23 to discuss your transition to Northeastern and the computational resources that we offer. Below is a summary of the topics that we discussed with some follow up questions. I also have attached Serena Caplins, Research Computing's Associate Bioinformatician, to the ticket so she can provide input as well in the discussion.

1. We talked about the storage needs of your group and moving about 120 TB of data to Northeastern. I shared our storage documentation page (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/storage/discovery_storage.html) that outlines different levels of storage that we offer including the free 35 TB of storage PIs receive. I also outlined the estimated costs associated with additional storage over the 35 TB for the different storage options we have including /work/<project> directory which is the active storage (estimate $150-160 per TB per year), NESE tape archival storage (estimate $10 per TB per year) and NESE disk (estimate $17 per TV per year). 
2. You inquired on the staging time of NESE archival storage to be able to use the data and the differences between the tape and disk storage which I said I would investigate and get back to you on.
3. I shared the data transfer documentation (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html) and said that we prefer Globus for large data transfers, but we do offer other forms of data transfer through the dedicated xfer.discovery.neu.edu node. We talked about compressing directories for the move to reduce the file count for the transfer also. I also shared you do not need to be on a VPN to connect to Discovery. 
4. You inquired the different software we have installed on Discovery and I shared that we offer software as modules and that you can request to have software installed as modules. We also have conda environments for programs and offer Singularity to run programs in containers. Also, you have the ability to install any required programs locally in storage space that you have access to on the HPC.
5. If you could provide a list of programs that you use, we can check on the availability of modules for those packages. 
6. I shared that you could access the HPC through the terminal with ssh but we also offer Open OnDemand (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-ood/introduction.html) for GUI applications such as JupyterLab, RStudio, Matlab, Schrodinger and other programs. 
7. We also talked about the shared partitions (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/hardware/partitions.html) that we have on Discovery including short, express, debug and gpu but the other partitions such as long, large and multigpu that you can request access to with a process showing your workflow fits the requirements.

If you have any other questions that came up in your group meeting or any additional questions that you would like to discuss, please reach out and we can work on them through this ticket and through future consultations. 

Thank you,

Joseph

For the tape storage, there are yearly costs associated with it for the maintenance of the hardware, the overhead with the storage system and purchasing of the physical tapes because there are a finite (2) number of times that they can be written to before the need to be replaced. The costs that are associated with it, is what the university pays for the storage. Also we do not have anything like Glacier or Snowball.

Cooke :

> > > 
> > > Thank you for booking a General Consultation with Research Computing on 07/11/23 to discuss your transition to Northeastern and the computational resources that we offer. Below is a summary of the topics that we discussed with some follow up questions. I also have attached Serena Caplins, Research Computing's Associate Bioinformatician, to the ticket so she can provide input as well in the discussion.
> > > 
> > > 1. We talked about the storage needs of your group and moving about 120 TB of data to Northeastern. I shared our storage documentation page (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/storage/discovery_storage.html <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/storage/discovery_storage.html> <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/storage/discovery_storage.html <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/storage/discovery_storage.html>> <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/storage/discovery_storage.html <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/storage/discovery_storage.html> <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/storage/discovery_storage.html <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/storage/discovery_storage.html>>>) that outlines different levels of storage that we offer including the free 35 TB of storage PIs receive. I also outlined the estimated costs associated with additional storage over the 35 TB for the different storage options we have including /work/<project> directory which is the active storage (estimate $150-160 per TB per year), NESE tape archival storage (estimate $10 per TB per year) and NESE disk (estimate $17 per TV per year). 
> > > 2. You inquired on the staging time of NESE archival storage to be able to use the data and the differences between the tape and disk storage which I said I would investigate and get back to you on.
> > > 3. I shared the data transfer documentation (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html> <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html>> <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html> <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html>>>) and said that we prefer Globus for large data transfers, but we do offer other forms of data transfer through the dedicated xfer.discovery.neu.edu <http://xfer.discovery.neu.edu/> <http://xfer.discovery.neu.edu/ <http://xfer.discovery.neu.edu/>> <http://xfer.discovery.neu.edu/ <http://xfer.discovery.neu.edu/> <http://xfer.discovery.neu.edu/ <http://xfer.discovery.neu.edu/>>> node. We talked about compressing directories for the move to reduce the file count for the transfer also. I also shared you do not need to be on a VPN to connect to Discovery. 
> > > 4. You inquired the different software we have installed on Discovery and I shared that we offer software as modules and that you can request to have software installed as modules. We also have conda environments for programs and offer Singularity to run programs in containers. Also, you have the ability to install any required programs locally in storage space that you have access to on the HPC.
> > > 5. If you could provide a list of programs that you use, we can check on the availability of modules for those packages. 
> > > 6. I shared that you could access the HPC through the terminal with ssh but we also offer Open OnDemand (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-ood/introduction.html <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-ood/introduction.html> <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-ood/introduction.html <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-ood/introduction.html>> <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-ood/introduction.html <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-ood/introduction.html> <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-ood/introduction.html <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-ood/introduction.html>>>) for GUI applications such as JupyterLab, RStudio, Matlab, Schrodinger and other programs. 
> > > 7. We also talked about the shared partitions (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/hardware/partitions.html <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/hardware/partitions.html> <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/hardware/partitions.html <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/hardware/partitions.html>> <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/hardware/partitions.html <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/hardware/partitions.html> <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/hardware/partitions.html <https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/hardware/partitions.html>>>) that we have on Discovery including short, express, debug and gpu but the other partitions such as long, large and multigpu that you can request access to with a process showing your workflow fits the requirements.

Cooke :
Hello Kate,

I talked with the senior HPC admin, Greg Shomo, for availability for the next meeting. Do you have any openings on Friday (6/21) afternoon?  If so we can narrow down a time and schedule the meeting. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Kate,

I have added Wallace and Rob to the ticket so they will be emailed the updates as well. 

Thank you for letting me know that for the next conversation you would like to focus on the data transfer aspect of the move. I will follow up on how to schedule that meeting. Also we can definitely setup a consultation with Serena for the bioinformatics workflow questions.

To answer your previous questions from a discussion I had with the senior HPC admin, the archival system does not have any sort of de-duplication measures in it. For the tape storage, there are yearly costs associated with it for the maintenance of the hardware, the overhead with the storage system and purchasing of the physical tapes because there are a finite (2) number of times that they can be written to before the need to be replaced. The costs that are associated with it, is what the university pays for the storage. Also we do not have anything like Glacier or Snowball. 

Knowledge base articles from Northeastern would be the best source of information for the different institutional programs that are offered. I will look up the location that you can search and see what is available for that. OneDrive and Sharepoint are the two that are commonly used and I can see if I can find more information (KB articles) for support on them with respect to collaborative efforts. 

I will update you once I find that information but I just wanted to pass on what I have found out thus far. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Hi Joseph,

No worries!  Could you please add wallacep@wi.mit.edu <mailto:wallacep@wi.mit.edu> and rgt@wi.mit.edu <mailto:rgt@wi.mit.edu> ?

For this conversation, we’d like to focus on the data transfer, so we’re most interested in talking to people who understand globus and the archive system.  Can you recommend anyone?

At some future point, we’d love to talk to your bioinformatics expert (was her name Serina?), but I don’t know if we’ll need the WI staff for that meeting.

Best,
Kate

Description : Hello,

   I had assigned a job to the discovery cluster (Matlab through OOD) through my Mac system last night from outside campus (running through Global Protect VPN) which ended abruptly/lost connection after 6 hours (did not reach the job execution time limit) as a result of which none of my script outputs got saved. I am pretty sure it was not a WiFi related problem. I don’t even know if the job completed and ran out of connection. Is there a way I can recover my script outputs?

Secondly, I reran the Matlab code in the cluster (as a new job) after the above incidence happened, travelled to campus while the job was running, only to see that there again was no VNC but I could see the job in running status in the active window where we see the status of our jobs (running/queued/completed). So I had to launch Matlab again and when I did that, my operation just restarted! Could you please help me around with why this would have happened?

Thanks and Regards,

Hello Priyanka,

The  node failure problem is addressed and you will no longer face similar issue. Please let me know if you need any further help.

Best,
Keval

Chheda :
Hello Priyanka,

It seems that the job is getting failed due to node failure. There are some of the nodes which are causing these issues. This means if you land on a node which has this problem, your job will get terminated. The systems admins are looking into this issue. I will keep you posted as the problem is solved in the next maintenance cycle.

reply from: p.ghosh@northeastern.edu

Hi Keval,

 Thanks so much for sharing the link to the training course. Even though I’m not facing any connection related issue with the cluster now, I am facing trouble (which I faced once in the past too) with accessing my MATLAB session after my script runs (I’m guessing it executes the entire script and closes). From the list of my interacting sessions, I learnt that my job is completed (even though it didn’t reach the time limit the was assigned). In such a case, how and where do I look for my MATLAB script outputs for the analysis that I ran?

Best,
Priyanka

reply from: p.ghosh@northeastern.edu

Hi Keval,

  Good to know that jobs can be run without VPN from outside campus, thanks! I am using interactive apps option to launch MATLAB based on my CPU/time/memory requirements which essentially opens a MATLAB like interface with editor/command line/workspace windows where I run my scripts.

Chheda :
Hello Priyanka,

Thank you for reaching out to RC. To access OOD outside from campus it is not necessary to use VPN. You can access it without VPN and submit jobs on OOD. Can you please let me know on how you submit jobs on the cluster.

Hello Larissa,

I discussed the issue with the team and we do have an issue with respect to using custom reservation on the desktop. We also discussed about your consultation with Surya today and he has a possible solution to your issue. Please continue to work with him for that solution and if that does not work we will try to deploy a custom application in your sandbox for testing. Let me know how the consolation goes!

Thanks,
Paarthvi

Doroshenko :
RITM Update: Hi Paarthvi,
That was my first instinct, but multiple gpu is not available for me via drop-down desktop application. Hence, my question and confusion. So yes, I'll gladly accept your help.
Larissa

Sharma :
Hello Larissa,

Apologies for the delay. Just to clarify are you using the Xfce Desktop option from OOD? If yes, there is an option to select the reservation from the drop down menu and launch the desktop.

Please let me know more about your setup so that I can help you out. 

Thanks,
Paarthvi

Doroshenko :
RITM Update: Hi Paarthvi,
I am not sure how to use this reservation. Can you explain it to someone who is not a CS major? I'm using network visualization software Gephi, which requires desktop functionality of the cluster (i.e., not just a command line). Typing in provided commands in the Discovery Shell Access doesn't do anything. Please help!

Sharma :
Hi Larissa,

I've created a multi-gpu reservation for you on a multi-gpu node with 4 v100-sxm2 GPUs, starting 9 AM on 8/21, lasting until 8/22, 7 PM. I can extend it more if needed. Also, please note that it is not required for you to run long simulations or on a full data set, this is just to show that your application is able to scale on multiple GPUs compared to a single GPU, so you can use shorter calculations to save you some time.

To see reservation information, type:

To use the reservation, simply add the following:

1. If running an interactive job, to allocate all 4 GPUs for example, type:

# srun -p reservation --reservation=larissa_test --gres=gpu:v100-sxm2:4 --time=24:00:00 -N 1 --pty --export=ALL /bin/bash

2. To submit your jobs to the scheduler, add the following lines in your sbatch script:

#SBATCH -p reservation
#SBATCH --reservation=larissa_test
#SBATCH --time=24:00:00
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:v100-sxm2:4


Additionally, for reservations, you can use the following to see your running jobs:

# squeue -u l.doroshenko --all
# sacct -S now -u l.doroshenko

Let me know if you have any additional questions!

Thanks,

RITM Update: Hi Paarthvi,

From 9 am on Monday, August 21 until 7 pm on Tuesday, August 22 would work well for me. If it works, I'll be able not only to test, but also finish most of the required analysis at this stage of the project.

Thank you,

Hi Handan, 

So sorry for the delay. Your courses space is up and running here: /courses/CSYE7105.202410/

See below for more information about courses this year on Discovery. Thank you so much and hope the class goes well!

Thank you for hosting your coursework on the Discovery cluster. We have some new features to help support courses this year:

Integration with Canvas — No need to send course rosters via CSV; we can pull these rosters from Canvas and add students, TAs, and teachers to your course groups automatically.
Standardized Unix Groups — There will be a single <course-code>.<term-code>-staff group comprised of all teachers and TAs for each course. Members of this Unix group will have read and write access to all files beneath the course directory. The students will have read and write access to courses/<course-code>.<term-code>/data and their username-specific directory under /students.
Per-Course Storage (by default) at /courses — We will automatically allocate 1TiB of storage to each course (if you need more storage, please let us know). This space will persist for the duration of the course and includes a directory, /data that all students can access.
Dedicated courses Partition — We now have a partition completely dedicated to courses with CPUs and/or GPUs depending on your course request. If we have developed an Open OnDemand app for your course, it will be hard-coded to use the course’s partition. If you are running commands on the command line or by using sbatch scripts, you will need to specify the partition with the -p courses flag. We have provided examples using srun and sbatch below for accessing the courses partition with CPUs and courses-gpu partition with GPUs :
For CPU
srun --partition=courses --pty /bin/bash
#SBATCH --partition=courses
               For GPU
srun --partition=courses-gpu --gres=gpu:1 --pty /bin/bash
#SBATCH --partition=courses-gpu
#SBATCH --gres=gpu:1
Your course and its related directories can be found via the file tree below:

/courses/
└── <course-code>.<term-code>
    ├── data
    ├── staff
    └── students
OOD Apps

We have three Open OnDemand (OOD) apps that appear at the top of the pull-down menu under “Courses” in the OOD Dashboard. These apps (Desktop, RStudio, JupyterLab) are available to students in any course using Discovery.

Additional questions or concerns: Contact us at rchelp@northeastern.edu, visit our website, view our documentation, or check out our training page. https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/

Thank you,

Caplins :
Hello Handan, 

Yes apologies for the delay. We are automizing courses this year and just need to run the script. I have requested that it be run Friday and I will make sure it gets done today. I will let you know when everything is all set. 

As for accessing the courses-gpu and courses partition. You will just need to set the partition flag as below (showing example for courses-gpu):
#SBATCH -p courses-gpu
#SBATCH --gres=GPU:1

We have 10 GPU nodes on the courses-gpu partition which will work for the multi-gpu portion of your course. 

Let me know if you have any other questions. Once the directories under /courses are set up for your course I will send you a more detailed email with all of the specifics. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Liu :
RITM Update: Good morning! Can you please complete my request today? It took 4 days from my submitting. My students will access Discovery tomorrow's class. Thank you!

Liu :
RITM Update: Thank you Serena, for your detailed information.
After you update this request ticket, can you please post here the commands to access reserved partitions? I know the previous version, but I'm not sure if the commands are changed with the changes of your policies. Or any link for userguide?
Another question is that, are the reserved gpu nodes 1-gpu nodes or multi-gpu nodes? When we start projects in November, my class needs multi-gpu nodes. In the past, I usually applied several reserved multi-gpu nodes in November for students to use about 2 or 3 weeks for their projects. Please let me know the process and what I should do to get multi-gpu nodes in November.
Thank you very much again!
Handan

Caplins :
Hi Handen, 

Thank you for contacting RC with your request. 

We have a slightly different setup for courses this year. Where instead of separate reservations for each course we have two partitions: courses and courses-gpu. When we process your classroom request we will add you and your students to both partitions which you can use on the OOD.  You can then use CPUs or GPUs are your discretion!

We will also build you a directory under /courses/CSYE7105.202410 which will have subdirectories for /students /staff and a shared directory for /data

More information will be to come. I'll start processing your request now. Let me know if you have any questions.

Cheers, 
Serena

Description : Hi, just a quick question: right now whenever I logged in OOD, the Files tab on the top only shows Home Directory, so as the side bar when I used the file explorer. However, I need to constantly explore the files in /work and /scratch. Is there a way I can add customized directories as a button/shortcut in the OOD shortcut? Thanks in advance.

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hello Yakun,

we're giving serious thought to your idea about adding /scratch and /work to the OOD File Explorer. It's a great suggestion and could indeed be very helpful. :

We can't say exactly when this will be implemented, but it's definitely on our radar. As soon as we have any updates, we'll be sure to let you know.

For now, we're going to close this ticket. But don't worry, you can always get in touch if you have more ideas or need help with something else.

Thanks again!

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Yakun,

Thanks for reaching out to RC.
Unfortunately, as of now, it is not possible to add new directories to the sidebar.
We appreciate your suggestions adding /scratch and /work would be helpful for users using OOD File Explorer.
We are looking into the possibilities and will inform you.

Description : Hey, I attempted to add a package in julia using Pkg.add("DifferentialEquations"), and got the following error:

typically, when this happens, it is an issue with a timeout or a denied request, i.e. the job I was running on c3085 was denied from accessing pkg.julialang.org and github, or it took so long to connect that it gave up. could you could you help me troubleshoot this please?

Cooke :
Hello Christopher,

Thank you for letting me know. If you have any other question please reach out to Research Computing at the following links: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/welcome/gettinghelp.html

Thank you,

Joseph

Blais :
Yeah just close it. I'll open a new one if it happens again.

Cooke :
Hello Christopher,

I just saw your update and you were able to get it to work. 

When you installed Julia, did you specify a particular channel for the install?

Also what does your .condarc look like? 

Let me know if you are still okay with resolving this ticket.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Christopher,

I just finished up with the conda environment and the installation went fine. I ran the following commands:

srun --pty /bin/bash
module load anaconda3/2022.05    
conda create -n julia -y
source activate julia 
conda install -c conda-forge julia      
julia

using Pkg
Pkg.add("DifferentialEquations")

You should be able to prefix your conda environment anywhere but I just did it in my $HOME for a test.

Thank you,

Joseph

Blais :
I have finished building the conda env and installing the julia packages. I guess to be really specific, Sundials/DifferentialEquations are dependencies that get installed with another package. The full command I am running is this: 

julia -e 'using Pkg; Pkg.add("PyCall");Pkg.build("PyCall");Pkg.add(PackageSpec(name="ReactionMechanismSimulator",rev="main")); using ReactionMechanismSimulator;'

So it adds and builds pycall (using the python executable for your conda env) then it adds/compiles "ReactionMechanismSimulator".  Differential equations is a dependency of "ReactionMechanismSimulator". 

The worst part is, it looks like it installed sundials and everything else fine. That's great, but now I have no idea what caused the issue. Yesterday, I tried multiple times and it would not install, even after starting over completely with a clean conda environment. This is not the first time I have something that seems to be network related basically halt my progress, only to disappear a few days later.  I have been using discovery for 4 years, I am not a newbie, but recently I have found it nearly unusable because of this. This obviously isn't your fault, I am just frustrated. 

I guess we can close the ticket. The only way I will be able to fix this is if I do some advanced debugging with the julia/conda package managers and see what specifically is causing the timeout. Maybe it is only on certain cpus that this happens. I don't know. Thanks for your help anyway.

Cooke :
Hello Christopher,

I just downloaded the Julia binary for linux here (https://julialang.org/downloads/) and ran 

using Pkg
Pkg.add("DifferentialEquations")

and it installed the package and I could add it with 

using DifferentialEquations

and it loaded. So it seems the package is compatible with the system. 

I will look into how to make a conda environment with Julia in it and try the package there.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Christopher,

No problem and completely understand. I am just trying the Julia binary right now to see if that installs the package fine. Then I will look into the conda environment. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Blais :
ok great, thanks. I am still building the conda env that contains the julia package that was throwing the error. It is taking a while today so apologies.

Cooke :
Hello Christopher,

No problem and thank you for the information. I have a copy of Julia and trying to install the package now to see if I get the error and to do some testing. I will let you know when it finishes and if I get the same error message or not.

Thank you,

Joseph

Blais :
Sorry was just giving it a shot in my other env. I am able to install other packages (just tried pluto)

Cooke :
Hello Christopher,

You are using the correct version of the discovery module. Have other Julia packages downloaded fine and it is only these are giving you issues or do all of them give issues in downloading?

Thank you,

Joseph

Blais :
I am using the discovery/2021-10-06, but maybe there is a more recent one, I haven't updated my bashrc/scripts in a while. when I did "module avail discovery" that's the most recent date.

Cooke :
Hello Christopher,

Thank you for letting me know. I will pull the Julia download and test out the process. In the mean time, could you run

module list

and see if a `discovery` module is listed when you are receiving the error message? It might be an issue of not having the proxies setup to pull the packages.

Thank you,

Joseph

Blais :
Hey Joseph, 
Thanks for looking into this. Currently I am just trying to install packages using the CLI package manager. It is using the julia anaconda package, so the julia binary is actually installed at /work/westgroup/ChrisB/_04_thesis/rmg_thesis. I am in the process of rebuilding it again so the package might not be there just yet, but it will in a few minutes.

Cooke :
Hello Christopher,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. How are you using Julia on the cluster? Are you using it through a CLI or through a JupyterLab instance with a conda environment? I will start looking into your inquiry but just need to know how you are using Julia so I can see about debugging the error message that you are receiving.

Thank you,

Joseph

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. 

For multi-gpu access you can submit a ticket. 
It works in two stages. There is a testing and post testing ticket where in the testing phase we setup a testing reservation for you to gather performance data and then in the post testing ticket provide performance data from the testing.

Description : Hello,

I am receiving this error : Disk quota exceeded @ dir_s_mkdir - /home/vasan.k/ondemand/data/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/jupyterlab/output/0374f6af-9db7-4237-8527-1c99e5c0659a


It looks like there is data storage available on my machine so I am not sure how to resolve this error. Can you please help?

Hi Kishore, 

Looks like you have exceeded your storage quota in your /home directory. You will be able to find more information on how to take care of this and monitor it here: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/welcome/gettinghelp.html

Using this command: du -h --max-depth=1 /home/vasan.k

You can see the breakdown below of the files that are taking up the most space. You are limited to 75 GBs in /home. For data files and conda environments we recommend keeping those in /work if you have access to space in work (this requires your sponsor to have a /work space setup and give you access). 

hope that helps!

Description : Hi，


I want to ask how long it will take to log in to my Discovery account after getting the account, and now I can't log in to it via ssh.

I have got the account about 15h.


Thanks,
Shanshan

Shenoy :
Hello Shanshan, 

Your account has been created and you should be able to login now. It usually takes a few hours after an account has been created for it to become accessible.
Here are some docs that can help you get started https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/first_steps/connect_mac.html

Do let me know if you are still facing any issues.

Thank you,
Prajwal

Shomo :
hello shanshan-

thank you for reaching out to RC !

accounts should be "up and running" when you get
the email saying "we setup your account on the cluster".

i can see that your account does exist and that there
are a bunch of failed-password entries in the logs
for sshd. 

if your account a new account ? sometimes new accounts
fall into a state-of-limbo that we are still working with the
AD-folks to figure out. every time this has happened, just
changing your NU password has been enough to resolve
the issue. 

let me know if that fits your case and if changing your password
fixes things up.

thank you 
&& happy computing !

I was compiling, but I suppose the compilation was using too many CPU resources.

I didn't know about:  srun --pty /bin/bash
But I'll use that from now on.

CPU usage: 40%
You should not use the login node for CPU intensive activities, as this can impact the performance of this node for all cluster users.
Also, It will not give you the best performance for the tasks you are trying to do. Please reference our documentation for more information: Next steps<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/index.html>.

If you are trying to run a job, you should move to a compute node. You can do this interactively using the srun command or non-interactively using sbatch command. Please see our documentation on how to do this: Using sbatch<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/sbatch.html>; Using srun<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/srun.html>.

If you are trying to transfer data, we have a dedicated transfer node that you should use. Please see our documentation on transferring data for more information: Transferring Data<https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/transferringdata.html>.

If you have any questions or need further assistance, simply reply to this email or book a consultation with us using the link on our Consultation page<https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/>.

Hi Gene,

Thanks for reaching out to Research Computing.

The normal method to kill a Slurm job is:
$ scancel <jobid>

You can find your jobid with the following command:
$ squeue -u $USER

If the job id is 1234567 then to kill the job:
$ scancel 1234567


In the Future, you can use a compute node whenever you're running a CPU-intensive Task.
You can use the below command for reference:
srun --partition=short --nodes=2 --pty --ntasks=2 --mem=4GB --time=01:00:00 /bin/bash

Hi Huiyu,

I'm glad to hear that your issue has been resolved!

You're right; each time you allocate a compute node with a GPU, you will need to load the necessary modules again. Though you can include those commands in `.bashrc`, we typically discourage modifying this file.

Instead, I suggest creating a script that combines all the necessary commands. This way, you can execute multiple actions with one simple command. Here's an example of what you could include in the script:


#!/bin/bash
module load anaconda3/2022.05 cuda/11.8
# Your additional commands, such as installing Python libraries or running your code


Don't forget to make the script executable by running `chmod +x your_script.sh`.

If you want to automate the process even further, you could consider submitting your job to Slurm using the `sbatch` command. You can learn more about this option in our documentation on batch jobs(https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/slurm.html#batch-jobs-sbatch).

Feel free to reach out if you have any further questions or need additional assistance.

Best,
Prasanth

Huang :
Hi Prasanth,

Thanks for your message! It solved my issue. I think I need to run those commands and install necessary python libraries each time if max time limit is enough to run my code on gpu. Is there any easier way to integrete/combine those commands into one command?

Bests,
Huiyu

p.dwadasi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Certainly! Your rewritten response looks like this:

Hi Huiyu,

Thanks for reaching out to RC. From the screenshot you provided, it appears you are still on a login node, as indicated by the prompt string `huang.huiy@login-00`. This is why CUDA is showing as unavailable since there is no GPU on the login node.

You can differentiate between a login node and a compute node by looking at the prompt string. On a compute node, the prompt string should show something like `username@dxxx`.

To access a GPU, you'll need to request a GPU node as mentioned in the documentation (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/workingwithgpu.html#gpus-for-deep-learning). You can do so with the following command:


srun --partition=gpu --nodes=1 --gres=gpu:v100-sxm2:1 --cpus-per-task=2 --mem=10GB --time=02:00:00 --pty /bin/bash

Here you can replace v100-sxm2 with the GPU you need. 

After that, you can load the necessary modules and Anaconda environment using:

module load anaconda3/2022.05 cuda/11.8

Please proceed with these steps, and let us know if you encounter any issues.

Best,
Prasanth

Huang :
I tried to follow the instruction on the pytorch part (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/workingwithgpu.html#gpus-for-deep-learning). But when I checked the installation: python -c 'import torch; print(torch.cuda.is_available())', the systerm returned False. Do you know how to solve it?

Description : Hi RC Team,

This is to inform you that I am facing problem while using Discovery cluster.
While trying to book a session today morning, I am getting this error message of 'Internal server error'. I have also attached the error screenshot.

If there is any information needed to resolve this issue, please let me know.

Shomo :
hello rahul-

thank you for reaching out to RC !

it looks like you are over quota in $HOME.
quotas are 75G for $HOME and i see that
your directory is at 140G at present.

is there some data you can transfer to your
PI's space in /work or to your /scratch space ? 

once you get below 75G, things should start
working again. 

i hope that helps !
[greg]

Kumar :
Thank you for your prompt response.
I understand due to shortage of staff, It will take some time to resolve my issue.

But the impact of this error is not low as mentioned below. I need to train the model and submit the results to Professor Maxwell.
Due to this error, I am not able to start the session.

Please consider it as an urgent request.

Thank you

Description : I log into discovery and go
$ module load anaconda3/2022.05

but the current version of conda is 23.7.3

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Erel,

My apologies on the delayed response. I just tested it with:

$ conda install numpy scipy pandas

and my environment was able to be build so I think something else might be the cause of the stalling on your build. Could you do the following for me to check a couple of things:

module list

before you run the conda install command. We are looking to see if 

discovery/2021-10-06

is listed because this is the module that sets the proxies to download packages. 

Also if you could cat the following file:

cat ~/.condarc 

which is where conda stores channels and also can list the proxies. If there are channels listed here that can increase the package install time and in some cases to hours in length.

Let me know when you check these two items and let me know if they were loaded and what is in your .condarc file.

Thank you,

Joseph

Levine :
I've already tried to install/update conda in my own environment. It is correct that 

$ conda list conda
# packages in environment at /home/e.levine/.conda/envs/py311:
#
# Name                    Version                   Build  Channel
conda                     23.7.2                   pypi_0    pypi

however, when I try for example
$ conda install numpy scipy pandas

I get the same message 
The environment is inconsistent, please check the package plan carefully

==> WARNING: A newer version of conda exists. <==
  current version: 4.8.2
  latest version: 23.7.2

and it stalls on Solving environment forever

Cooke :
Hello Erel,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. When using conda environments we can install the latest version of conda inside of our environments. We have documentation on using conda located here (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/conda.html) but I just tried out the following and found out that it updates it to 23.7.2

srun --pty /bin/bash
module load anaconda3/2022.05
conda create -n test python=3.11 -y
source activate test
conda install conda
conda update conda
conda list

and it shows 

conda                     23.7.2          py311h06a4308_0 

and when you run 'which conda', it shows

~/.conda/envs/test/bin/conda

We recommend building conda environments for your research projects because it allows you to tailor your setup with the specific versions of the packages that you want and that fits well with the goal of reproducible science. 

Does this answer your question and do you have any other questions?

Thank you,

Joseph

  1)  is not a valid URL, or

From searching online, the issue seems to be the use of a proxy server. The proxy server name and port needs to be specified before I can install the package.

With that said, what is the Discovery proxy server informatn? I wasn't able to locate that on the Northeastern website.

No problem. I think it was an underlying issue with my environment and trying to load directly into the environment rather than starting from base. I have created a new environment and am implementing better environment management to keep them from getting too large/convoluted so I think we can say this issue is resolved. I have also changed the startup to only load in to the base conda environment and havent encountered this issue since.

Hi Griffin, 

Sorry for the delayed response (about to respond to your teams message as well). If you haven't already double check that you have jupyterlab installed in your custom conda env. 

Hope that helps,

Hi guys, 

I believe the problem may be caused by my conda environment since starting the session without specifying it worked. I am still troubleshooting this problem though so I will keep you updated

In your ticket, the efficiency scores for GPUs (1,2,3,4) weren't specified. It's crucial for us to receive these scores, as they help us understand how your application scales with an increased number of GPUs.

Before submitting a post-testing ticket, have you conducted scalability tests on your application? If you haven't done so yet, we kindly request you to raise a multigpu testing ticket. You can do this at the following URL: https://bit.ly/NURC-PartitionAccess.

Best Regards,

Description : Hi there,

Hope you are doing well. As part of our proposal submission, I want to check if the following information is still up to date:

Northeastern University is a member of a consortium of Boston area schools that have collectively developed the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGPHCC) in Holyoke, MA. The center recently opened in 2012. The MGHPCC provides an invaluable increase in the computing capacity to Northeastern and also serves as a showcase of green energy use and green facilities design. The facility, created to support the computational research of MIT, Boston University, Harvard University, University of Massachusetts and Northeastern University, presently houses a 2000-core X86-based Dell Blade computing cluster, along with 500 TB of storage. The system also provides 16 NVIDIA K20 GPU nodes. This specific system is dedicated for use by researchers from Northeastern University.  There are also two additional shared computing clusters coming online through the MGHPCC consortium, increasing the number of computing cores to close to 10,000.

I would really appreciate if you can help me with any numbers that have changed by now.

Thanks,

Hi Ehsan,

Thanks for reaching out to RC regarding this. Apologies for a tardy response. Our most up-to-date information is pasted below. Feel free to take whatever you need from it for your proposal submission. Good Luck!


The Northeastern ITS Research Computing (RC) team provides high-end research computing resources to all Northeastern University affiliated faculty, researchers, and students. The team also manages Northeastern’s partnership with the Massachusetts Green High Performance Computing Center (MGHPCC). Resources available to the Northeastern community include a centralized high performance computing (HPC) cluster, storage, software, high-level technical and scientific consultations, education, documentation, and training. All of these resources are available to all faculty and students, with RC staff available to assist researchers through consultations on how to leverage hardware and software for scientific applications and workflows.

As of January 2023, the Discovery cluster provides access to over 45,000 CPU cores and over 400 GPUs to all Northeastern faculty and students free of charge. Hardware currently available for research consists of a combination of Intel Xeon (Cascadelake, Skylake_avx512, Broadwell, Haswell, Sandybridge and Ivybridge) and AMD (Zen, Zen2) CPU microarchitectures. Additionally, a selection of NVIDIA Pascal (P100), Volta (V100), Turing (T4), and Ampere (A100) GPUs. Discovery is connected to the university network over 10 Gbps Ethernet (GbE) for high-speed data transfer, and Discovery provides 6 PB of available storage on a high-performance file system. Compute nodes are connected with either 10 GbE or high data rate InfiniBand (200 Gbps or 100 Gbps), supporting all types and scales of computational workloads.

A dedicated team of PhD scientists and staff manage the RC environment and support researchers in their use of the Discovery cluster resources. The RC team updates computational resources available through Discovery with the newest technologies on a yearly cycle to support the cutting-edge research being performed by Northeastern faculty and students.

Research groups who require access to dedicated computational resources can request to be part of a “buy-in” option, integrating their hardware into the Discovery cluster to provide unified access to both private and shared compute nodes for their research group members. Faculty-owned hardware that is part of the Discovery cluster is fully managed and maintained by the RC staff at no charge.

Alternatively, researchers can transfer grant dollars to RC to enable a ‘Co-op’ or paid allocations model. Principal Investigators (PIs) can purchase CPU or GPU hours, or storage capacity, tailored to the specific needs of a research project and/or grant. This alleviates the need for PIs to purchase capital equipment directly.

I have figured out what's wrong with her login. Is there a command I can use to check which students have been added to the course on Discovery?

Thanks!

Hi Sijia, 

Her account is active  on discovery and she has been added to the CHEM5641.202410 unix group. Do you know how she was trying to connect? 

Her username (without the @notheastern.edu) and northeastern password should be all she needs to login to the OOD.

We can definitely work on making sure everyone can get logged on today in the introductory session. By the way, do you have a zoom link for the today?

Caplins :
Hi Sijia, 

Thank you for reaching to to RC and letting us know about changes in enrollment for you course. 

We have a new process underway to create course directories and to add students to those spaces. The good news is that we will now be pulling the enrollment information directly from canvas, so you will not need to update us on any changes in enrollment. The less good news is that we are still implementing this process. However, we assure you that the space for your course and the correct list of students will be in place by Monday the 11th. 

There will be more communication about this coming very soon. 

Cheers,

Hello Joseph,

Following this information, I have moved my work to the scratch folder. Yet, I see disk space utilized in my home directory (through the du --sh ~ command) as 97G. I cannot determine why the additional space is being utilized. Any pointers for this?

Cooke :
Anyone can claim. They are just over quota in $HOME.

Cooke :
Hello Atharva,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. I am sorry about you receiving the error message and that is preventing you from opening up a Jupyter Notebook session. The disk quota that it is pointing to is your $HOME quota so /home/joshi.at. I just ran the command 

du -sh ~

to get the total of your $HOME and it is currently at 103G  which is over the 75 GB quota that we have set. If you move some of the files to your /scratch space (just remember there is a 28 day purge policy on the space) or if you can move research work into a /work space. Does your PI have a /work space setup if you have research work in your $HOME directory that could be moved?

Here is a page from our documentation on checking your storage spaces and some helpful tips on keeping your $HOME under quota. (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/homequota.html#home-directory-storage-quota)

Please let me know if you have any other questions and if there is anything that we can help with.

I used to be able to access the internet on the compute nodes but now I cannot.

they do not work.
I still have internet access on the login nodes.

What should I do?

we do not forward icmp packets to the internet,
so ping should not work from a compute node.

the ssh-bits to github are slightly different. they

not happy with github changing their ipaddresses
every now and then.

can you clone from 'xfer.discovery.neu.edu' this

Description : Hi Bernardo,

Hope you're doing well.
Below is the summary of the consultation we had on Monday(9/25/2023)

Issue: User was unable to install hic-straw conda package on discovery.

We started with creating a virtual environment to install the necessary package, but encountered an issue: the specific package was sourced from a third-party channel. Consequently, we had to include these channels in Conda.

Subsequently, it was essential to ensure that the channel priority in Conda was set to "false" so that Conda could search for the package in the designated channel.

Further complications arose related to Python compatibility, as hic-straw was only compatible with Python versions 3.8 or lower. This necessitated downgrading the Python version. Following this, we encountered a challenge involving conflicting glibc versions in Discovery. The hic-straw package and the installed glibc were not compatible, leading us to install hicstraw via the "mamba install" command. To resolve this, we first installed mamba and then hicstraw.

Finally, we managed to create the environment with the required package successfully.

However, another issue persisted. Despite creating the environment, we were unable to call the environment in Jupyter Lab in OOD (OnDemand). Even after specifying the custom Conda environment path, OOD continued to use the default Conda environment. We are still in the process of identifying and resolving this issue.

Below are the commands that we used to get hic-straw work in discovery:

"""
export HTTP_PROXY=http://10.99.0.130:3128
export HTTPS_PROXY=http://10.99.0.130:3128
export OUTDATED_IGNORE=1

conda create --prefix=/home/b.zubillagaherrera/hic_straw python=3.8 anaconda -y
conda activate /home/b.zubillagaherrera/hic_straw
conda config --set channel_priority false
conda update --name /home/b.zubillagaherrera/hic_straw --override-channels --channel defaults --all
conda config --add channels jrhawley

conda install mamba -c conda-forge
mamba install -c jrhawley hic-straw

conda activate /home/b.zubillagaherrera/hic_straw

Description : Hi Joseph,

   I hope you're doing well.

I'm reaching out with the hope that you and/or the RC team could help with some file conversions that are needed for a journal publication.

I've been working with Greg Shomo the past week & he recommended that I reach out to you if I run into any issues (as he is out of the office today & tomorrow).

In short, Greg was able to locate a set of bam files from sequencing runs & upload them to my Discovery file directory. I was able to unzip & unpack the .tar.gz folders on my computer. https://ood.discovery.neu.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/files/fs/home/n.pinkhover under "all-those-bam-files.tar.gz".

Unfortunately, once the folders were unpacked the files were supposed to be in their original FASTA format but are still in bam format. I tried converting to FASTA unsuccessfully most of yesterday. I'm running Win 10 (which doesn't help, of course), but all commands are in Linux & I wasn't able to install samtools for Windows via Ubuntu bash shell.

It would be greatly appreciated if you'd be available to assist with the above at some point today? I'm able to meet via Teams until ~3:30pm.

Thank you in advance,

   Nicholas Pinkhover

Caplins :
Great to hear!! 

Don't hesitate to reach out again if you need anything else. I'll close this ticket. But you can open another if you find you're missing some samples or need anything else. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Pinkhover :
Hi Serena,

I untarred the consensus FASTA file & ran the following command "cat consensus_fastas/IonCode_XXXX_consensus.fasta" on a few of the samples & then did a BLAST on NCBI. :

So far, all samples are correctly being identified as SARS-CoV-2 & things are looking great.

I'll finish doing the above tonight & let you know if any of the samples aren't ID'd as SCV2. 

it is very much appreciated!! :

All the best,
Nick

Caplins :
Yes I was so happy when I found the .fastas. :)

They're in your home. You can untar with this command:

tar -zvxf consensus_fastas.tar.gz

And if you would like any other samples or need anything else from the archivedReports let me know. There's some variant analyses files in there as well. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Pinkhover :
reply from: n.pinkhover@northeastern.edu

Serena,

  That’s fantastic news!!

Sharing the .tar files to my /home directory will work great.

I’m a bit tied up at the moment, but will send an update asap.

Again, thanks so much!!

Nick

Caplins :
Hi Nick, 

I have wonderful news! I found your consensus fastas in the archivedReports directory! They were well hidden but all are present. I just wrote a script to collect all the 66 that you needed and am going to tar them up and place them in your home directory if that is okay. I can also put them in your /work if you prefer. 

I was searching for more information on what ion torrent did post assembly with trinity and happened to find a directory called generateConsensus..... that had the fastas. I checked and they're all around 29k base pairs. 

Let me know if home is okay or if you prefer a different location. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Pinkhover :
Hi Serena,

I was not available for most of yesterday. :

My calendar is open today from 1:30pm-3:30pm ET if you’d like to catch me up to speed with a quick Teams meeting?

Feel free to let me know if you have any availability today!

Thanks,
Nick

Caplins :
Just saw your question: Were the two Trinity-assembled samples you tested generated using any of the files names listed above?

Yes, I tested the assembly with IonCode_0204_rawlib.bam and IonCode_0205_rawlib.bam

So the path for the IC_0205 will be helpful. 

Thanks.

Caplins :
Hi Nick, 

Great. I will work on a script that aligns to the ref and creates a consensus. I'll get back to your shortly. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Pinkhover :
NCBI SCV2 ref. genome for sequencing assembly linked below.

https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947
https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/nuccore/MN908947.3?report=fasta

Pinkhover :
Hi Serena,

  Thanks for the update.

If I'm not mistaken, that's how the Ion Torrent Suite software generates the assembled genome for each sample. See file path below.
 
/home/n.pinkhover/tfisher_seqdata/archivedReports/Auto_user_2772919110235-8-SARS-CoV-2_Insight_FTIC-Custom-Dilution_237_081/plugin_out/IRMAreport_out.193/IonCode_0205/intermediate/4-ASSEMBLE_SSW

From here, you'll see a series of "FX-2019-nCoV_MN908947.bam" files with "X" ranging mostly from 1-6 (I believe the value corresponds to # of parallel reads) & the MN908947 is the SARS-CoV-2 reference genome. 

Another possibility is: "/home/n.pinkhover/tfisher_seqdata/archivedReports/Auto_user_2772919110235-8-SARS-CoV-2_Insight_FTIC-Custom-Dilution_237_081/plugin_out/IRMAreport_out.193/IonCode_0205_clean_bam/intermidiate_files".

Here, you'll see files named either: IonCode_XXXX_rawlib.consensus.bam" or IonCode_XXXX_downsample.consensus.bam". Again, being a novice to bioinformatics, I think files with "rawlib.consensus.bam" are low-read # samples, while "downsample.consensus.bam" are high-read # samples. I'm just postulating here based on large differences in file size between "downsample" vs "rawlib".

Were the two Trinity-assembled samples you tested generated using any of the files names listed above?

Thanks again & please let me know if I can provide further detail.

Best,
Nick

Caplins :
To clarify we could map the sample trinity assembly to the reference genome

Caplins :
Hi Nick, 

Just wanted to send you an update. I have a script that works to run the assembly. I have tested it on two samples and it runs very quickly (within a few minutes). However, the output was highly fragmented and consisted of 100-200 "transcripts" that were from a few hundred base pairs in length to ~6kb.  Not quite close to the 29kb that you're expecting. 

Do you know if Ion Torrent did anything with the data post-assembly? For example we could map the trinity assembly back to the genome and create the consensus that way. 

Happy to send you the script that I have as is or modify it to also perform the next step. Let me know what you prefer. 

Also happy to arrange another meeting to walk you through using the script. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Caplins :
Hi Nick, 

Yes that works great! See you then. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Pinkhover :
Hi Serena, 

After 4pm would work best. I can send out a Teams invite for 4:15 if that time works for you?

Best,
Nick

Caplins :
Hi Nick, 

Yes sounds good. The sooner you get the assemblies going the sooner they'll be done. 

I'm free tomorrow from 1-2 or after 4 PM. Which would you prefer?

Cheers, 
Serena

Pinkhover :
Hi Serena,

Thanks for looking into this further.

I'm unable to access the: "/work/tfisher_seqdata/archivedReports/Auto_user_2772919110235-11-TBFW-NGS-RUN_13JAN2022_HM-Dilutions_241_tn_088/plugin_out/AssemblerTrinity_out.251/drmaa_stdout.txt" file path, so, I can't comment on that.

I'll pull the QC & assembly file paths from one of the local samples (i.e., the fasta I pulled up on Team Viewer from the Ion Torrent Server today) & try to share the paths on Discovery tomorrow.

That being said, I agree with your last statement most at this point. It looks like doing a batch assembly using the Trinity module is probably my best bet.

My calendar is open (fairly) all day tomorrow. If you have some availability tomorrow, it would be much appreciated!

Thanks,
Nick

Caplins :
Hi Nicholas, 

It was nice meeting with you today. I spoke with Greg briefly and he showed me the archivedReports directory. I couldn't find any .fa or .fasta files in there for any of the samples. I looked a little more closely at this file which looked like the same output you showed me: /work/tfisher_seqdata/archivedReports/Auto_user_2772919110235-11-TBFW-NGS-RUN_13JAN2022_HM-Dilutions_241_tn_088/plugin_out/AssemblerTrinity_out.251/drmaa_stdout.txt

Plugin Execution Error :
SGE exit_status: 1

So perhaps this is why the fasta files aren't present? Or I am missing something since you have QC information on the assemblies? Do you happen to have an example output file name that I could look for?

However, it doesn't look terribly promising that the output you need is hiding in that directory. In which case I suggest moving forward with re-assembling the data. it looks like IonTorrent was using Trinity to assemble. Let me know when you'd like to move forward with that and I can get you set up. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Pinkhover :
Hi Serena,

Thanks for the follow up. This afternoon at 3:30pm works great.

I'll send out a Teams invite.

Best,
Nick

Caplins :
Hi Nicholas, 

Yes that's all I would expect the script to remove, so we should definitely meet to discuss what you'd like to do. I'm free this afternoon after 3:30 PM. I also have availability tomorrow. You can book a consultation with me on my bookings page or through teams. My availability is up to date on my calendar. https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/

Cheers, 
Serena

Pinkhover :
Hello Serena,

I hope all is well with you.

Apologies for the delayed reply, I was out Wednesday & Thursday last week. I was able to run the suggested "awk '!a[$0]++' output.fasta > output_no_dups.fasta" command last Friday, unfortunately, this only removed reads that were 100% identical (i.e., nucleotides & read length). The resulting .fasta files were still highly homologous & larger than they should be.

If you have 5-10min where you are free today, I can better explain what the goal is by sharing my screen via Teams.

Please feel free to let me know if you have any availability.

My best,
Nicholas Pinkhover

Caplins :
Hi Nicholas, 

I hope you are doing well. I'm just jumping in for Joseph here as I have some experience working with fasta files (and he was covering for me while I was on vacation). 

I'm not sure why a few duplicates are being left behind. But you could try this awk statement to see if that removes the rest of them? This line is removing duplicates based on their sequence (and not looking at duplicate headers as removing the headers seems to have already happened here). 

awk '!a[$0]++' output.fasta > output_no_dups.fasta

Does that remove the remaining duplicates?

Cheers, 
Serena

Pinkhover :
Hi Joseph,

So, I just ran the following:

sort output.fasta | uniq > output_wo_duplicates.fasta

grep -v ">" output_wo_duplicates.fasta

This resulted a readable nt FASTA output without headers, & culled the reads from >2M down to 686,233 total. This is a vast improvement, however, the nt sequence still seems to have many duplicate reads line-by-line. 

I'm tied up in meetings from 3:00-4:00pm, but will be free after 4:00pm if you have 5-10min to take a look today via Teams? If not, any insight on additional/alternative Unix commands that could help the above would be greatly appreciated!

Thanks,
Nick

Pinkhover :
Hi Joseph,

I realize how busy RC is on the day-to-day. Thanks for the command info! :

I ran the grep cmd using "output_wo_headers.txt" cmd, unfortunately, I wasn't able to save the resulting .txt output as a human-readable file or copy-paste the nt sequence. I was able to resolve this by running "grep -v ">" output.fasta", which generated a readable FASTA file without the headers (as everything following ">" was culled from the header).

I am going to test some "sort output | uniq > output_wo_duplicates" commands & I'll let you know how I fare.

Best,
   Nick

Cooke :
Hello Nick,

My apologies on the delay on getting back to you on this. 

If you want to remove duplicate lines (please check and make sure the output is what it should be as well but this should do it) but you can use a couple of unix commands like we did to remove the headers.

After the headers are removed,

grep -v ">" output.fasta > output_wo_headers.txt

run the following command 

sort output_wo_headers.txt | uniq > output_wo_headers_wo_duplicates.txt

which should remove the duplicate lines.

Thank you,

Joseph

Pinkhover :
Hi Joseph,

I just got the grep cmd to work! Headers have been removed. :

Last thing to tackle is removing duplicate reads (as this issue still seems to persist despite the correct .bam file conversion).

Cooke :
Hello Nick,

Let me look at a couple of other things that you can try to run to remove the headers. I will update the ticket when I find something that may work.

Thank you,

Joseph

Pinkhover :
Hi Joseph,

I've tried running the grep command a few different ways but keep running into "too many arguments" errors.

I can paste the text from the terminal here, or create a Teams call if you're available for a minute or two today.

Please let me know what is easiest for you.

Thanks,
Nick

Pinkhover :
Disregard my previous post. I was able to log in now.

Pinkhover :
Hi Joseph,

I started running commands in the terminal as usual, but after attempting to paste the grep-v command (it did not end up pasting in the terminal) I was kicked & haven't been able to login or establish a connection since.

"ssh: connect to host login-00.discovery.neu.edu port 22: Connection refused 
Your connection to the remote server has been terminated."

I tried logging out & back in with no luck. Any ideas as to what happened?

Thanks,
Nick

Cooke :
Hello Nick, 

Not a SAMTools command but a linux command you can run because if all those lines start with '>' we can use that to our advantage with grep. In the directory with the .fasta file run the following command:

grep -v ">" output.fasta > output_wo_headers.txt

which will search for any lines that begin with ">" and removes them and saves it to a new files called  output_wo_headers.txt.

Try this out and see if this works for what you are looking for and let me know.

Thank you,

Joseph

Pinkhover :
Hi Joseph,

Thanks! Yes, luckily Thermo replied to my inquiry yesterday late afternoon.

The correct bam files to convert are the "2019-nCoV_MN908947.bam" files for each IonCode sample.

I was able to convert some yesterday, but there is one last question I had for you regarding samtools commands that can (hopefully) clear the headings in between reads. Please see below (the ">RCCG9:03889:05127" portions that are above each read segment).

[n.pinkhover@c0442 IonCode_0204]$ cat 2019-output.fasta
>RCCG9:03889:05127
AACAAACCAACCAACTTTCGATCTCTTGTAGATCTGTTCTCTAAACGAACTTTAAAATCTGTGTGGCTGTCACTCGGCTGCATGCTTAGTGCACTCACGCAGTATAATTAATAACTAATTACTGTCGTTGACAGGACACGAGTAACTCGTCTATCTTCTGCAGGCTGCTTACGGTTTCGTCCGT
GTTGCAGCCGATCATCAGCAC

If you're aware of any samtools commands that would allow for just the (ACTG's) nucleotide reads to be displayed, that would help immensely.

Thanks,
Nick

Cooke :
Hello Nick,

I am just reaching out to see if you heard back from the instrument company on which .bam files you should be working with and if you have any other questions in terms of the converting of the files?

Thank you,

Joseph

Pinkhover :
1:30pm works great. 
Thank you,
Nick

Cooke :
Hello Nick, 

I have time today at 1:30 pm if that works for you? Let me know and I will add it to my calendar.

Thank you,

Joseph

Pinkhover :
Hi Joseph, I was able to “cat output.fasta” & get the IonCode_204_clean.bam in FASTA format (as we did during our Teams meeting last week). However, there are a few things I could use some help with if you’re available to meet via Teams today? I don’t think it will require much time now that the commands are more familiar to me. Please let me know if you have any openings today & thank you in advance! 
Best,
  Nick

Cooke :
Hello Nick,

I am just reaching out to see if the message I sent with the commands helped get the conversions done or if you would like to schedule a consultation with me?

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Nick,

I have a couple more meetings this afternoon. I was just checking on my tickets when I had a moment. 

At what point are you getting stuck with the conversion? We might be able to work through this in a ticket and if not schedule another meeting. 

Just a quick run down of what we did yesterday:

srun -N 1 -n 24 --pty /bin/bash

which will get us on a compute node.

We will need to module load the two modules for the programs we need to convert the files.

module load samtools/1.10
module load seqtk/1.3

Then we will need to change the directory to the directory with the _clean_bam file that we want to convert:

cd /home/n.pinkhover/tfisher_seqdata/archivedReports/Auto_user_2772919110235-8-SARS-CoV-2_Insight_FTIC-Custom-Dilution_237_081/plugin_out/IRMAreport_out.193/IonCode_0204_clean_bam/

The two commands that we will use to convert the clean bam to the fasta and fq file formats are:

samtools fasta IonCode_0204_clean_bam.bam > output.fasta
samtools bam2fq IonCode_0204_clean_bam.bam | seqtk seq -A > output.fa

The cat command is a means of just viewing the contents of a file:

cat output.fasta 

will just output all the contents of the file to the terminal. You can open that file up in the File Explore in OOD to view the contents as well and possibly download the file to your local machine and use a text editor to view it. I don't know what parts of the file you will need for your workflow.

Please let me know if this helps and if you have any other questions.

Thank you,

Joseph


srun -N 1 -n 24 --pty /bin/bash

module load seqtk/1.3

samtools fasta IonCode_0204_clean_bam.bam > output.fasta
samtools bam2fq IonCode_0204_clean_bam.bam | seqtk seq -A > output.fa

Pinkhover :
Hi Joseph, thanks for following up. I noticed your status on Teams was “busy” & didn’t want to interrupt anything. After our meeting, I made several attempts to retrace steps & commands to get to the point we had reached yesterday. Unfortunately, I think there were a few “cat” commands (possibly a few others I’m forgetting) that I couldn’t find in the Teams chat or in the terminal you & I were working in. Are you available at all this afternoon? Thanks very much, Nick

Cooke :
Hello Nicholas,

I am just reaching out to see if you have any other questions and if the data conversion went well.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Nicholas,

I have just setup a Teams meeting at 11 am this morning and sent it to you. We can see what we can get setup and running in that time to get the files converted over for you. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Pinkhover :
Hi Joseph, No worries at all. I should be free around ~10:40 for a Teams meeting. I also have most of the afternoon open (after 2:30pm). Best, Nick

Pinkhover :
Hi Joseph, 

Cooke :
Hello Nicholas,

I have time this morning until noon and then some time this afternoon as well. Let me know what works well for you and I should be able to book a Teams meeting. Sorry for the delay in getting back to you.

Thank you,

Joseph

Pinkhover :
Hi Joseph,

Yes, that'd be great. What time(s) are available on your calendar?

In its entirety, the dataset is ~35Gb. Please let me know if I can provide anything else.

Thanks,
  Nick

Cooke :
Hello Nick,

Would you want to schedule time tomorrow to have a Teams call and try and get this running on Discovery? How large is the data set?

Thank you,

Joseph

Pinkhover :
Joseph,

Please see the below biostars &  threads with samtools command recommendations 

https://www.biostars.org/p/129763/
https://www.biostars.org/p/279923/

From SAMTools: 

samtools fasta input.bam > output.fasta

samtools bam2fq input.bam | seqtk seq -A > output.fa

From BBMap Suite: 

reformat.sh in=your.bam out=seq.fa

The linked threads are much more in depth & include additional links to other posts, GitHub pipelines etc. Hopefully this helps.

Best,
  Nick

Cooke :
Hello Nicholas,

I completely understand. I ask because we have SAMTools installed on Discovery so if the data is already on Discovery we should be able to do the conversion on Discovery. I have not used SAMTools previously but do you have an example set of data that I could use and see if I can work out a pipeline?

Thank you,

Joseph

Pinkhover :
Hi Joseph, I was trying to install samtools as a last-ditch effort to try & convert the files myself while is out of the office. I am not a CS/bioinformatician of any sort, but as this issue is very time-sensitive for publication, I wanted to exhaust all efforts before reaching out. 

I reached out to Greg in hopes to convert the previously mentioned bam files to FASTA format on Discovery, but we haven't been able to do so thus far.

Cooke :
Hello Nicholas,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing and thank you for asking! Today I am a little busy meeting wise (for this afternoon) but I am more open tomorrow so we could book something then. Are you trying to do the analysis on Discovery or are you trying to do it locally (since you said you are trying to install SAMTools through the WSL Ubuntu shell)? I will look more into the file structure format as well.

Thank you,

Joseph

Hello Christine,

Jennifer's account has been created and I have just added Jennifer to the `larylab` unix group. That will take 2 hours to propagate through the system to become active. Jennifer will have to sign out and sign back into Discovery because unix groups are assigned at login and if you are using OOD, you may also have to select the Restart Web Server option under the Developer menu in OOD for it to update the unix groups on OOD.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Description : Dear Support team,

I would like to access my HTML files and view them by creating a new tab. I was able to do this in the past, but cannot after the discovery system was updated. My colleague (Emma Tinney) also submitted a similar ticket a while ago, and the solution has something to do with creating a sandbox in my home directory (hope this rings a bell!). Would be great if you could help with this!

Hi Meishan, 

Yes we can copy the older version of the Files app to your developer folder and you can access it via the "sandbox". 

I've gone ahead and copied to your home directory (under ondemand/dev). Can you try to launch it and let me know if it works? You will open the OOD dashboard and select "Develop" from the right hand side. Then "My Sandbox Apps" and select "Launch Home Directory" under the File Explorer app. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Description : Hello,

I recently tried to start a Jupyter Notebook instance in Open OnDemand and received the following error:

Disk quota exceeded @ dir_s_mkdir - /home/t.lazovich/ondemand/data/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/jupyterlab/output/72a7d186-2916-4035-bdf0-87e7761f84f4


I don’t believe I have anything that should be taking up a lot of disk space so I’m not sure what the issue is. Can you provide any insight?

Description : We’re at a JSALT workshop in France now with just 2 weeks to go until the final presentation

We really need a few machines with lots of memory.

I think that means d0129 and d0130

It looks like we are competing with someone else for d0130 and d0129 is in drain (not sure why)

Is there anything we can do to get some machines with lots of RAM for a little while?

Shomo :
hello ken-

jsalt finished up and i'm going to resolve this ticket.

[greg]

Church :
reply from: k.church@northeastern.edu

thx

I’m using both d0130 and d0129 now

Seems to be running wonderfully

Shomo :
as our configuration stands today, when a node
is in a reservation, none outside of those allowed
to use the reservation have access to the resources.

if you are not running jobs there, the nodes will
be idle.

[greg]

Shomo :
hello ken-

i've just cleaned up d0130 for you. you could run

scontrol show node d0130

but that would just tell you that the last person's job
did not exit cleanly and slurm took the node offline.

in any event, your bits are running now. 
[greg]

Church :
reply from: k.church@northeastern.edu

is there a way for me to find out what d0130 is doing?

squeue -p reservation | egrep d0129
          37832120 reservati run_cheb k.church  R    1:04:38      1 d0129
          37832106 reservati run_cheb k.church  R    1:04:38      1 d0129
          37832114 reservati run_cheb k.church  R    1:04:27      1 d0129
          37832101 reservati run_cheb k.church  R      55:38      1 d0129

(gft3) [k.church@c3085 cumgraphs.V2]$ sinfo | egrep 130
debug        up      20:00      4  drain c0599,d[0003,0020,0130]
express      up    1:00:00      4  drain c0599,d[0003,0020,0130]
short*       up 1-00:00:00      4  drain c0599,d[0003,0020,0130]
long         up 5-00:00:00      4  drain c0599,d[0003,0020,0130]


It looks like it is in drain.  Am I not allowed to see who is using it?

Church :
reply from: k.church@northeastern.edu

thx!

We won’t need this after Aug 3 (French time)

But if we don’t launch jobs, does that allow others without reservations to get the machines

Shomo :
ps. both of these nodes are running jobs right 
now, but as those jobs complete those nodes
will be reserved to group 'nlp'

Shomo :
hello ken-

i've just set aside both d0129 and d0130 for users
of the group 'nlp' for the next 14 days. in order to use
these nodes in the reservation, please include the 
following in your jobscript

#SBATCH --partition=reservation
#SBATCH --reservation=jsalt

as this is a reservation, there is no timelimit, etc and
i set it up such that everyone in group 'nlp' has access
to the reservation.

i hope this helps !

Hello Rishabh,




Thank you for booking a consultation with me yesterday, Here is a brief summary of our discussion:




You wanted to install OpenCV in a PyTorch environment with Cuda support. You followed our documentation (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/using-discovery/workingwithgpu.html) to install Pytorch with Cuda support, But once you installed OpenCV using Conda the Cuda support for pytorch seemed to break.




I was able to successfully install OpenCV in a PyTorch environment with Cuda support. I have outlined the procedure which I followed here:




1. Request a compute node: $ srun --partition=gpu --nodes=1 --gres=gpu:v100-sxm2:1 --cpus-per-task=2 --mem=10GB --time=02:00:00 --pty /bin/bash

2. Load the required modules: $ module load anaconda3/2022.05 cuda/11.8

3. Create a conda environment for PyTorch installation: $ conda create --name pytorch_env python=3.10 -y

4. Activate the created conda environment: $ source activate pytorch_env

5. Install PyTorch: $ conda install pytorch torchvision torchaudio pytorch-cuda=11.8 -c pytorch -c nvidia -y

6. Once PyTorch is installed, install OpenCV using pip: $ pip install opencv-python




Additionally, I have attached my environment.yml file which can be used to create a conda environment with OpenCV installed: $ conda env create -f environment.yml -n pytorch_cv




Please try this out and let me know if you face any issues.




Best,

Surya

Description : Dear RCHelp,

I am an authorized user of the partition: lilisu. However, recently for no reason at all, I observed that some jobs on node d3194 would be shutdown at around 4am EST.

Description : Hello,


I haven't been able to scp with Discovery, from outside Discovery, in well over a month. This is true across different computers (my personal computer and my office desktop), and I've restarted both of them more than once in that time.
The output of the command is different across the two computers:

From my laptop:

[(base) [nate@ssh_nate prota]$ scp n.avish@xfer.discovery.neu.edu:test.txt .

[n.avish@xfer.discovery.neu.edu's password:

scp: Received message too long 1281454964

scp: Ensure the remote shell produces no output for non-interactive sessions.

From my desktop:
[(base) [nate@acadia home]$ scp n.avish@xfer.discovery.neu.edu:test.txt .
[n.avish@xfer.discovery.neu.edu's password:
Last updated 9/5/23

Two of my colleagues, both grad students, are also having this issue, and have been for a little while. If I remember correctly, it started for me after the major outage over the summer.


If I use scp from within Discovery, it works perfectly fine. And scp also works on my laptop and desktop if I'm not using it with Discovery. That is, the following two commands work:

On Discovery:
scp test.txt target-computer@elsewhere.edu

On my laptop or desktop:
scp test.txt some-other-computer-that-isn't-Discovery@elsewhere.edu


Any suggestions on how to fix this?

That fixed it, thank you! That line WAS the only stdout in my .bashrc, so it was a very simple fix. Thank you also for explaining what's going on.

Shomo :
hello nate-

thank you for reaching out to RC ! 

ssh is a relatively simple protocol that
talks over a single port. therefore, when
you first login, any output from the remote
host is assumed to be STDERR (ie, an error)
and the connection closes. 

i think if you remove line 16 (cat babysitting),
you might be OK going forwards. ssh sees
the output of `cat` and assumes that is an 
error, then quits out.

give it a shot and lmk ? i did not read the
rest of your  .bashrc, so there may be other
places that write to stdout also.

thank you !
[greg]

While most of our data is de-identified, we may need encryption for some data that could be identifiable, like digital phenotyping data. Could you provide that for some of the space? Are there any negative considerations to working with encrypted data (e.g., more corruptible? takes up more time or space?)? Thanks!

Sure, that's reasonable. We will need enough storage for 1 MRI study of 80 participants, several behavioral studies, and we will soon be collecting an MRI study and associated digital phenotyping data. For now, perhaps 5T?

I will need full access and Jay Burns, my lab manager, will also need permissions. Can you please help us set up our accounts?

Shomo :
hello alexandra && thank you for reaching out to RC !

do you require all 35T immediately or in the course of time ? 
updating your group's quota is (literally) changing one integer
in a config file, so is neither onerous nor time-consuming. 
consequently, we try to keep limits in the "what you expect
to require in the next six months". if that changes, just let
us know and we'll update our end, etc.

additionally,, who should have access to this space ?
i don't think you have an account at present, but please

Hello Ben,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. For the shared gpu partition the time limit is set to 8 hours max. What type of research are you completing or mainly what types of programs you will be utilizing and can they be checkpointed? Ideally, we suggest researchers to checkpoint their jobs and resume from the checkpoint as best practice and we can assist in how to use job arrays to resume jobs from their previous checkpoints.

The directories are generated in /courses now. For the BINF6310 courses, there is space in /courses/BINF6310.202410/ which include a data, staff, and per student directories. 

Please let me know if there are any questions. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Soufan :
RITM Update: This sound great. Thanks for the update. Please keep me posted with regard to the storage.

Cooke :
Hello Othman,

You are welcome. For command line access, your students can use ssh to connect to Discovery or use the Discovery shell program from Open OnDemand to connect to Discovery with terminal access. From there, they can use srun to get an interactive session (be placed on a compute node) and can module load miniconda from there. 

We have a partition setup for course use and it is the courses partition and can be accessed with srun or sbatch:

srun -p courses -c 2 --mem=2G --pty /bin/bash

for a 2 core and 2 GB of memory job on the courses partition and you can adjust as needed. 

Your course will have storage setup at /courses/BINF6310.202410 but we are still working on finishing that up. I will let you know when that is all setup.

Do you have any other questions that I can help with?

Thank you,

Joseph

Soufan :
RITM Update: Hi Joseph,

Thanks for reaching out. 

For the time being, I am looking only for the command line access. There is no specific conda environment as of now. I assume this can be easily addressed in the future if needed.

Regards,
Othman

Cooke :
Hello Othman, 

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. We have miniconda3/23.5.2 installed as a module on Discovery. For your class, do you require an Open OnDemand application or just access to the command line? Also do you need a conda environment built or are you going to have student's build their own environments?

Thank you,

Joseph

To view your current disk usage, please use the following command:
$ du -h -d 1 /home/yun.hy


https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/homequota.html :
1. Consider cleaning up some packages which are no longer needed in /home/yun.hy/.local/
2. Consider using conda virtual environments or pip virtualenv to manage your packages. This will give you more flexibility to export your Python environment to different places if needed.
3. Rebuild your Python environment inside a dedicated group /work directory. $ pip install --target=d:\somewhere\other\than\the\default package_name
If your group doesn't have a shared storage space under /work yet please request your PI/advisor to fill in the "New Storage Space request" form: https://bit.ly/NURC-NewStorage. Note that this request has to be filled out just once by a faculty member from your group.
The location /work is persistent storage, where each research group gets up to 35TB of free storage across all storage tiers. See this page for more info:https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/storage/discovery_storage.html#discovery-storage
4. Consider moving all of your important data folders to the /work-shared group location for permanent storage.

Just a gentle reminder of this persistent issue.
I was reading about it online<https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/44976>. They mention resetting IOMMU. Not sure what that means.
Even though !nvidia-smi command does not list any active process, it could be a process that was not killed properly.

Description : Dear RC Help,

I hope this finds you well! I'm trying to SSH from my local computer into a jupyter lab server running on an interactive mode node (-pty).

I'm running into a couple issues. The current method I'm using is:

  1.  Creating a tmux terminal
  2.  in the tmux terminal, running "srun --partition=gpu --nodes=1 --gres=gpu:t4:1 --cpus-per-task=2 --mem=16GB --time=03:00:00 --pty /bin/bash"
  3.  Now that im in the session (juang.c@login~00 --> juang.c@d1005), I start a jupyter lab server "jupyter lab --no-browser --port=8888"
  4.  On my local computer, I ssh from port :8888 locally to :8888 on the server "ssh -t -t juang.c@login.discovery.neu.edu -L 8888:localhost:8888 ssh d1005 -L 8888:localhost:8888"

From this, I am getting this error:

(base) caden@pop-os:~$ ssh -t -t juang.c@login.discovery.neu.edu -L 8888:localhost:8888 ssh d1005 -L 8888:localhost:8888
bind: Cannot assign requested address
channel_setup_fwd_listener_tcpip: cannot listen to port: 8888
Could not request local forwarding.
Last login: Tue Oct 10 15:59:11 2023

How can I resolve this, and is there an easier way to access Jupyter lab through an interactive mode node? I know that I can just use OOD, but when I'm not on the Northeastern network, I need an alternative solution.

Thank you,

Caden Juang

Shomo :
hello caden-

that's weird, but possible. there's a "yes, i agree to your
terms, etc" over at MIT, but perhaps you were on a college
wifi (eg, csail) rather than main-campus.

in any event, i would suggest configuring your laptop, etc
to use 'eduroam'. that should give you access from any
university (and most colleges) in north america.

in any event, glad it worked 
&& happy computing !

Juang :
reply from: juang.c@northeastern.edu

Hey Greg,

I've been off campus a couple times lately but it's always to MIT. I think their guest Wi-Fi blocks some sort of connection that prevents me from accessing OOD. I just tried accessing OOD from my phone hotspot and it worked. :

Thanks again for the help,

Caden Juang

Shomo :
hello caden-

thank you for reaching out to RC ! 

if i may ask, why do you need an alternative
solution when you are not on NU network ? 
OOD should "just work" in those situations as 
well.

Cooke :
Hello Caden,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. Let me look into the process that you are completing but what do you mean that you cannot use OOD when you are not on Northeastern's network? You can access Open OnDemand while you are not on Northeastern's network and everything should work normally. What are you encountering while you are trying to do that?

Shomo :
hello srirupa-

thank you for reaching out to RC ! 

i've just added ken.wong to your group. 
this takes about 2h to propagate throughout
the cluster but should be all-set by 0820 EDT
today.

as unix groups are only allocated at login, ken.wong
should logout of any open ssh-sessions (after 0820) 
and log back in to the cluster.

if ken.wong is using OOD, then please advise that
they select "Restart webserver" from the "Developer"
menu in the top, black, horizontal menubar. 

thank you 
&& happy computing !

Hello Erel,

I am going to resolve this ticket since we haven't heard back from you in a bit. If you have any other questions please reach out to Research Computing at the following links: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/welcome/gettinghelp.html

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Erel,

I am just reaching out to see if you were able to get the submit script working or if you would like me to review it and make some suggestions to see if we can get it running as expected?

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Erel,

You are welcome and I am glad to hear that Tensorboard is working well on OOD. 

In your sbatch script, are you including the module load for anaconda3 and also sourcing your environment? If you load the module and source the environment on a compute node and submit an sbatch job, the job will not maintain the environment you submitted it in so you will have to setup the environment in the actual job script. If you want to send me a job submission script, I can assist in helping get it setup.

Thank you,

Joseph

Levine :
Hi Joseph, 

Thanks for checking back. Yes, Tensorboard on OOD works well. The only thing I couldn't figure out is the fact that sometimes when I send my jobs with sbatch everything works fine, and at other times I get

ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorboard'
srun: error: d1024: task 0: Exited with exit code 1
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "/home/e.levine/noam/2023_OSL/OSLnet_remove_sides.py", line 8, in <module>
    from torch.utils.tensorboard import SummaryWriter
  File "/home/e.levine/.local/lib/python3.9/site-packages/torch/utils/tensorboard/__init__.py", line 1, in <module>
    import tensorboard
ModuleNotFoundError: No module named 'tensorboard'
srun: error: d1016: task 0: Exited with exit code 1

I always run sbatch from a compute node, after loading the anaconda and cuda modules and after activating my pytorch environment. 
Thanks!
Erel

Cooke :
Hello Erel,

I am just reaching out to see if you were able to use Tensorboard from OOD and if that fits your workflow. Do you have any other questions?

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Erel,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. We have Tensorboard installed as an Open OnDemand application (ood.discovery.neu.edu) where you can enter the directory where your log files are located and launch the application on Discovery. You use Tensorboard through your web browser with it running on Discovery. 

Would a solution like this work for you?

Thank you,

Joseph


Satheesha :
-> They want to understand how to run tensorboard on the discovery cluster.
-> They would run it on  localhhost:6006 on their computer. They would like to know how to do it on discovery cluster.
-> The customer would like to be reached on Microsoft Teams if possible.


----------------------------------------
Description : Hi there. This afternoon (Jul 24, 2023) I had two problems with the Discovery cluster that I hadn't experienced.

1) I've been unable to successfully allocate jobs today on partitions I usually use. See screenshot below for an example interactive job on "short". They are all immediately failing with "Force Terminated job..."

2)  I'm able to connect to the login nodes (via SSH) as usual. But today, I've been intermittently unable to connect to the data transfer (xfer) nodes via SFTP. I'm getting "connection refused".

I checked the RC status on the website about an hour ago and everything looked green. So I wanted to see if there is some ongoing outage that explains these two. Or if this is a me-specific problem. Thanks for any info you can provide!

Hello Zulqarnain,

I am just reaching out to see if you were able to use the slurm job arrays to get your jobs submitted and if you have any other questions?

Thank you,

Joseph

Khan :
Hi Joseph,

Thank you! this is super helpful. Will try this out and get back to you if I need more help!

thanks,

Cooke :
Hello Zulqarnain,

Thank you for letting me know that the job can be checkpointed and are submitted with sbatch with a bash script. 

Absolutely! The idea of using job arrays are to enable us to submit a series of jobs to be run either in batches or in sequential order. Is it a set number of epochs before you have to restart the job or does it change based on what point of the job you are in?

https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/checkpointing.html#application-level-checkpointing). :

The key is you are going to set 

#SBATCH --array=1-10%1  # execute 10 array jobs, 1 at a time

a line like this where each array job is a set number of epochs to start the next job. So if the job is taking 3 days and you can run in 8 hour chunks because of the partition, you can set something like 

#SBATCH --array=1-12%1  

which will run 12 jobs in total but 1 at a time.

You will need to index the python starts to use the slurm job array id like 

python input.py checkpoint_$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID

where checkpoint_$SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID would be the inputting check point and will increase in value with each array job that was submitted so it will iteratively advance without having you submit them manually. 

Some more examples of slurm array jobs can be found here as well https://github.com/northeastern-rc/training-slurmarrayjobs.

Please let me know if you have any other questions.

Thank you,

Joseph

Khan :
Hi Joseph,

Yes the job is able to be check-pointed. The jobs are being submitted with sbatch with a bash script that runs a python script. Currently we save checkpoints every 'n' epoch and then once the time runs out, we run it again, the python script looks for and loads the latest checkpoint. Would you be able to share an example of how we can remove the manual step of running the bash script again? Let me know if you need more info.

thanks,
Zulqarnain

Cooke :
Hello Ajay,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing and sorry about the late response. 

please correct me if I am misunderstanding that. Are the jobs OOD based or are you submitting them via the command line and sbatch? We should be able to help write a job array script to resume the job from the last checkpoint so you won't have to manually submit the jobs to get to the 3 days or so of run time if they are submitted via the command line. :

How many jobs do you have to run for this workflow as well?

Thank you,

Joseph

I did want to ask if you were planning on using it on the command line or looking for an interactive app like the one available here https://wenmr.science.uu.nl/auth/register/
If both command line and app are intended we will like build it in a container which is looking like the preferred solution anyways as it has a lot of dependencies. 

We also are only able to make the program available to you and members in your lab due to the licensing agreement.

Subject: SQL Database Related CHG Awareness | Azure Apps | NIST 800-171 Compliance
When: Thursday, September 14, 2023 2:00 PM-2:25 PM (UTC-05:00) Eastern Time (US & Canada).
Where: Microsoft Teams Meeting

Hi All -

I'm currently working with the Cloud Technologies & OIS teams on a Vendor-involved engagement where we're remediating certain Azure resources to align with NIST standards (PRJ0122228).  This time is intended to:

  1.  Be used as an awareness sync, regarding a SQL DB related change currently being planned - as the DBA, D. Studio & Research Computing groups have been identified as Owners
  2.  Garner understanding on any internal NU Testing that may need to happen, and how the timeline needed for that work might impact the timeline for pushing this change to Prod.
  3.  Communicate to the D. Studio team details regarding a Vendor-provided PIR - related to a rollback which occurred in May
     *   Collect any insights/details needed for any resolution testing


The Communication doc attached outlines that 'All public endpoints to the SQL Instance will be disabled and private endpoints to the SQL Instance will be provisioned. Access to the SQL Instances will be allowed through Northeastern's VPN.' This will be accomplished through the use of applying an Azure policy.

The attached 'Azure-NIST_SQL-DBs' excel lists the relative databases that will be impacted by the Azure policy, separated in tabs by each associated group.


Please feel free to reach out with any initial questions, and invite any specified others who may be necessary for discussion/awareness -

Description : Dear RC team,

I hope this email finds you well. I am writing to inform you about an issue I am encountering with connecting to the Discovery server.

As of 19:20 10/14/2023, I have been unable to access the server. I have attempted basic troubleshooting steps, such as checking my internet connection, rebooting my computer, and trying to access the server from different devices, all to no avail.

The work I am involved in is critically dependent on the resources and data stored on the Discovery server, and this disruption is significantly affecting my progress.

Could you please assist in resolving the following queries:
- Is this a known issue, and are other users experiencing similar difficulties?
- What might be the cause of this issue?
- Is there an estimated timeframe for when the server will be back online?

Your prompt attention and resolution to this matter will be highly appreciated. Additionally, should you require any more information or logs from my end to assist with the troubleshooting, please do not hesitate to ask.

Thank you in advance for your support and cooperation.

Warm regards,

Chenxi

RStudio fails to start when I launch a session via OnDemand.

Hi,

Startup didn’t work but luckily I got a prompt to start in safe mode…which did allow R to load.  From there, I terminated what appeared to be a hung session (I got a message saying that R had crashed in the last session) and was able to restart a normal session after that.

So all resolved!

Thanks so much for your help,

Caplins :
When you run an R session do you typically save the data to the .Rdata? 

I wonder if it is trying to reload an intensive session from the last time you used it and then timing out. 

In this case I can move the directory that runs rstudio in your ondemand folder to off. A new one will be generated when you try to relaunch RStudio. In this case none of your scripts will be lost but you will have to reopen them and get things back to where you had them. 

Let me know if you'd like to try that.

Welsh :
reply from: a.welsh@northeastern.edu

The app never starts.  I just get a spinning wheel and then grey.  Occasionally I see a prompt that says “R is taking longer than usual to load.” With an option to terminate, start in safe mode (tried this to no avail), etc.

I don’t think we’ve ever used R in a conda environment, so not sure if that is the issue.

Thanks,
Amanda

So the app never actually starts? It moves from queued to complete?

You can try moving your .conda to .conda-off in case something there is interfering. I have had this happen in my own case before when I installed some r packages in a conda environment in my home.

Hi,

I moved the file and tried relaunching.  No change in outcome – grey screen.

Hi Amanda, 

Of course. You can use the OOD app. 

From the dashboard go to "Clusters" and "Discovery_shell_access"

This puts you in your /home directory on Discovery. 

You can then run the command:

mv .Rhistory Rhistory-off

which moves the file .Rhistory to a file called .Rhistory-off

You can then close the browser window and launch another Rstudio session.

Welsh :
reply from: a.welsh@northeastern.edu

Could be – can you walk me through how to move the Rhistory off?  I am not adept with Unix – really only use the OnDemand app.

Thanks,
Amanda

It may be that you have a lot in your .Rhistory that R is attempting to load in when it starts. You can try moving your .Rhistory to off and try launching another session. 

mv .Rhistory .Rhistory-off

Caplins :
Hi Amanda, 

Firefox should work....but if you can try google chrome that will help narrow down the problem. I'll continue checking that nothing in your home from past instances is interfering. 

Thank you,

Welsh :
reply from: a.welsh@northeastern.edu

Hi,

No change.  I am able to start a session but the RStudio screen remains a gray blank.  I will note that a session I opened on Monday did hang…is there some unclosed item because of that?

Note that I am using Firefox.  Should I try in Chrome or some other brower?

Thanks,

Hi Amanda, 

I don't see anything unusual in the output logs. It looks like it may have timed out which could have been due to a slow internet connection. 

Can you try again and this time try restarting the web server but going to the "Develop" tab on the upper right of the OOD dashboard and selecting "Restart Web Server"

And then try launching another Rstudio session?

Description : We are trying to profile a GPU application on an A100 machine with Nsight NCU. To profile with ncu, sudo permissions are needed. Greg (from Discovery RC team) fixed this in 2022, by adding the command `/shared/centos7/nsight/2021.3.1/ncu` to the sudoers configuration. 

However, when running with sudo, none of the user space environment variables / dynamically loaded libraries (.so) are not available. We have been able to get around this by compiling all our programs & libraries statically. This results in large binaries but avoids runtime library loading. 

We are testing a new compiler framework for GPUs that relies on C++14 standard or newer. However, when invoking `/shared/centos7/nsight/2021.3.1/ncu` with sudo permissions we noticed that the GCC module (along with GLIBCXX) defaults to an older version resulting in the following errors. 

[malithjayaweera.d@d3106 src]$ sudo /shared/centos7/nsight/2021.3.1/ncu --csv --metrics achieved_occupancy ./main

How do we resolve this issue?

Steps to Reproduce
===============

1. Navigate to my user folder.

Description : Dear RC team,

I'm using Julia in a Jupyter notebook via OOD and trying to add the package Plots.jl. I have tried this inside the notebook with
      
      using Pkg; Pkg.add("Plots.jl")

and in a terminal with

      module load julia/1.8.5
      julia
      ]
      add Plots.jl
      precompile

In either case precompiling fails because of certain dependencies that are missing. These are:

  Cairo_jll
  Qt6Base_jll
  HarfBuzz_jll
  libass_jll
  FFMPEG_jll
 FFMPEG
  GR_jll

I have attached the full error message in a textfile.


I would be greateful, if you could help me resolve this problem.

Kind regards,
Moritz Laber

reply from: laber.m@northeastern.edu

Don't worry that this takes longer than expected. I'm myself sorry for keeping you busy all the time.

I renamed the folder and did a fresh install of Julia by downloading and unzipping.

The installation of Plots and IJulia went through without any error messages. The good news is that the Julia-1.9.2 kernel starts smoothly. But unfortunately, I'm still not able to use Plots, because the precompilation fails. Note that the .julia is a new one that gets created automatically once I install any packages, and not the one that I renamed into .julia-off.

Best,
ML

Cooke :
Hello Moritz,

I was able to replicate the julia kernel not connecting. There might be version conflict in your .julia directory in $HOME. 

If you could run 

mv .julia .julia-off

which will just rename your .julia directory to .julia-off to complete this test. Then could you run the following:

srun --pty /bin/bash
cd julia-1.9.2/bin
./julia

Using Pkg
Pkg.add('IJulia')
Pkg.add('Plots')

which will reinitialize a .julia directory for you with a clean state with the notebook connector and the plots package. See if this works and you are able to attach your Jupyter Notebook to it then. 

Again, my apologies on the delay in getting this debugged.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Moritz,

No need for apologizing and I am sorry for the delayed response to your questions.

I am trying to determine what might be causing it not to be able to connect to the kernel now. There is a hidden directory in $HOME that is created .julia that has packages install in. I am trying to investigate a solution to this. I am trying to replicate the issue so I can debug it.

Apologies on the delay in getting this solved.

Thank you,

Joseph

Laber :
reply from: laber.m@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

the HTTP error was only temporary and I could install Julia in its on conda environment.

However, I was neither able to precompile IJulia nor Plots. While I see now both a Julia-1.8.5 and Julia-1.9.3 kernels in the Jupyter notebook on OOD, I can't connect to either of them anymore.

The problem persists independent on whether I start the notebook with the custom conda environment "julia" or without any environments selected. I'm selecting the system wide conda-module anaconda3/2022.5 when starting the notebook.

I'm sorry that I'm keeping you busy with this issue.

Best,
Moritz

Laber :
reply from: laber.m@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

Thanks for your help. When I try to install Julia in the environment, I keep getting HTTP errors (see picture).  Do you think that this is a temporary connection thing or is something else wrong?

Best,
Moritz

[cid:image001.png@01D9DFDE.F5D040A0]

Cooke :
Hello Moritz,

Thank you for your patience while I tested this. I tried to install an older version of Julia and set it up for JupyterLab and only the first version appeared as an option. 

I tried to use the conda route again and I did the following:

srun --pty /bin/bash
module load anaconda3/2022.05
conda create -n julia -y
source activate julia
conda install -c conda-forge julia
julia

using Pkg
Pkg.add("IJulia")
Pkg.add("Plots")

which is similar to what we tried a little bit back. An error message appears that not all components are installed but when I open up JupyterLab and load the Plots package in the Julia Notebook, it plots. Could you give this a try and see if this works to generate plots for you.

I can look further into creating another environment and having the latest version of Julia be priority over the module version.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Moritz,

Sorry that it didn't work. I am still trying to debug this because I installed an older version of Julia and only the newest one shows up as available in JupyterLab as a notebook or kernal. Trying to see if multiple versions of Julia can be available or if it is only one version at a time in an environment.

Thank you,

Joseph

Laber :
reply from: laber.m@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

Don't worry, there is no rush.

I tried what you suggested. The installation worked but then


  1.  I can't select a Julia-1.9.2 Kernel in the Jupyter Notebook
  2.  If I launch the notebook with the Julia-1.8.5 Kernel, I'm not able to load plots. I receive the error message that you can see in the screenshot below.


Am I doing something wrong?

Best,
Moritz

[cid:image002.png@01D9D732.ED3F3720]

Cooke :
Hello Moritz,

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you about this. I couldn't get Plots to build with IJulia in conda for it to work on Open OnDemand's Jupyter Notebook. What I found that worked was downloading the latest version of Julia and installing the packages in my $HOME environment which allowed it to work on OOD. I did the following steps:

srun --pty /bin/bash
wget https://julialang-s3.julialang.org/bin/linux/x64/1.9/julia-1.9.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
tar -xvf julia-1.9.2-linux-x86_64.tar.gz
cd julia-1.9.2/bin
./julia

Using Pkg
Pkg.add('IJulia')
Pkg.add('Plots')

Then in OOD, I was able to open JupyterLab and select the Julia Notebook and I was able to using the plotting feature then. 

Could you try this and see if this works okay for your workflow?

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Moritz,

Let me test a few things out to try and get Julia working within JupyterLab with Plots.jl.

Thank you,

Joseph

Laber :
reply from: laber.m@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

Thanks for your reply.

No, I have not tried it within a conda environment. I only loaded the module Julia/1.8.5 module.

Yes, I'm going to work at least for some projects with JupyterLab. It would be great if you could test if it works
Inside the notebook, too. If it does I'll use this setup.

Best,
Moritz

Cooke :
Hello Moritz,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. Have you made a custom conda environment for your Julia package installations? I just tried the following from the terminal and the Plots.jl package installed fine.

srun --pty /bin/bash
module load anaconda3/2022.05
conda create -n julia -y
source activate julia
conda install -c conda-forge julia
julia

using Pkg
Pkg.add("Plots")

How are you using Julia within JupyterLab? I can test and see if this installation works from there.

Thank you,

Joseph

Description : Hello,

We are doing sequencing analysis on Discovery with a heavy data load, and halfway through we’ve run out of disk space on /work/daylab.

Have we reached the 35TB storage/disk space limit that each lab can get for free, or are we currently allotted less than that?

I put in a request for 35 TB, hopefully that will fix the problem, but please let me know if we already have 35 TB then we’ll figure out a different solution.

Thanks, Tovah

hello tovah-

thank you for reaching out to RC !

your lab had an 11T quota. you are correct that
our current configuration allows up to 35T for free
and i have increased your group's quota to that limit.

i hope that helps 
&& happy computing !
[greg]

ps. too many labs requested 35T "on day one" and 
lots of them have zero-files on the cluster, so we now
allocate space in 5T or 10T chunks. that way, we know
it's not sitting idle. apologies for the delay it casused, though.

I have made multiple attempts to access the BrainVAE folder, but unfortunately, I have been unable to do so successfully. Each time I try to access the folder, I receive the following error message:

/work/brainvae/code :
Error occurred when attempting to access /pun/sys/dashboard/files/fs//work/brainvae"

I have also attempted to resolve this issue by restarting the web server, but that did not rectify the problem.

The BrainVAE folder is crucial for my ongoing work and research, and I would greatly appreciate your assistance in resolving this matter as soon as possible. If there are any specific actions I should take or additional information you need from me to address this issue effectively, please let me know, and I will be more than happy to cooperate.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter, and I look forward to your guidance and support in resolving the access issue.

Best regards,

Atharva

Description : Hi,

I've been using node d3024 recently and after the power outage from the weekend, the node has in two different cases failed. I was wondering if someone could look into this, as it might affect future job runs. After the node fails, all jobs get cancelled and the node gets reset. A screenshot of this phenomenon is below:

[cid:f8c96c31-0ae3-46b0-9e42-eef147106253]

Can provide more information if needed.

Thanks!

Hi Greg,

Yes I do interactively. Generally, I run a singular training job that utilizes ~2 gpus, maybe 40-60 G memory each GPU, with 64 gigs CPU memory? The first time I saw it crash, it was in the middle of my job. The next time I saw it crash, it was after my job had completed and I was idling on the node. There's a chance that someone else propagated it? This definitely happened after the power outage, so something about bringing the node back up has made it slightly problematic.

hello millicent-

thank you for reaching out to RC !

we do not have much data to go on here, 
as it looks like you typically run interacitvely
on the node. can you characterize the work-
load, etc ? that will help us to track down 
where to look for the problem.

thank you !

Hello Shruti and Saeed,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing and like Manasvita said, apologies on the late response to your inquiry. 

Currently no one on the team is versed in Firebase and its implementation and use so we would not be able to provide much assistance in this direction for your project and development. My apologies for that but we just are not currently suited for that direction of work. 

Deploying your app through the static URL running on a node for a limited time in a reservation is currently still on the list of tasks that we are working on and apologies on the delay in getting that setup for you. 

If you want to discuss this further we can schedule a meeting and talk about it. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Description : Hello,

Hope you are well. I was wondering if you could give me an update on the discovery maintenance issue. It has been down since yesterday and an update would be greatly appreciated.

A lot of grad students have an important deadline today. There are only 3 such conference deadlines in a year which are of particular significance, and it is very difficult to plan ahead without communication and a sudden lack of resources.

The possibility of logging in to access files at least would be very useful if there is further delays.

Thanks for your time and patience.

Sanjana

hello sanjana-

we just got power restored about an hour ago.
you should be able to login in the next 15m or so.
the compute nodes will take a couple of hours for

Hi Joshua, 

The maintenance window is from 5AM -5PM EST tomorrow and impacts the whole cluster. Jobs are the long partition will not be run due to the maintenance window impacting there requested runtime. But they can be run end of day tomorrow. 

We recommend just leaving the jobs in the queue. They will run as soon as the maintenance is over.

Description : RC,

Is there any possible way to get a more modern conda experience? The conda installed is VERY old and I don't have the permissions to update it.

[Screenshot 2023-10-07 at 11.59.08 AM.png]

This is needed due to the fact that the base conda files are not correct for newer python modules.

[Screenshot 2023-10-07 at 12.02.00 PM.png]

This is exceptionally frustrating as it's inhibiting my ability to do my work. I've tried updating it myself but I can't because I don't have permissions to do so.

Can someone please help with this?

@Cooke, Joseph The user also needs to install Jupyterlab while creating the environment otherwise it wont be reflected in OOD.

Cooke :
Hello John,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. The version of conda you are seeing when that messages comes up is the base version of conda in the anaconda module. You can update/install conda within your custom conda environments like:

srun --pty /bin/bash
module load anaconda3/2022.05
conda create -n test python=3.11 -y
source activate test

shows:

(test) [j.cooke@c2200 ~]$ conda --version
conda 4.13.0

but we can install conda inside of the environment:

conda install conda -y

which will install the following version in your conda environment:

conda                     23.9.0          py311h06a4308_0  

and when you run 

(test) [j.cooke@c2200 ~]$ which conda
~/.conda/envs/test/bin/conda

that it will be using the version of conda you installed in your environment. 

Could you try the following and see if this allows you to install your python packages?

You can also install the latest version of miniconda and instead of sourcing anaconda3 you can source your miniconda environment. We have the miniconda install documented in our RTD (https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/packagemanagers/conda.html#using-miniconda). 

Thank you,

Joseph

Hi Greg,

I received notifications that Raphael and Tom are no longer with the Research Computing team at Northeastern University. I checked out the RC website and found your name/email address.

Below is an offer to reinstate TotalView at the University. If you are not familiar with TotalView, it is a tool used by researchers, developers and those in the HPC space. Attached is a brief introduction, and more information can be found on our website, www.totalview.io<http://www.totalview.io>. I saw in your bio that  you have managed HPC systems at MIT; they are also TotalView users.

In addition to the offer below, is anyone from the Research Computing team planning to attend Supercomputing 2023 in Denver this year? We will have a booth, and I’d appreciate the opportunity to meet and bring you or your colleagues up-to-speed on what’s new with TotalView.

If you’re not the right person to work with on either of these, please point me in the right direction.

Thank you,

Lisa

Subject: Revisiting TotalView - Special Offer


Hello Raphael and Tom,



I hope you’ve been well over the last year!



Last year Northeastern University declined the TotalView renewal due to a lack of use. Since then, several features have been added in releases that dramatically simplify and accelerate debugging of complex code running on workstations to HPC supercomputing systems.



Here’s a brief recap of what’s been added that you may find to be of value: 



·       AMD GPU and ROCm debugging support.

·       NVIDIA GPU and CUDA debugging enhancements.

·       Data visualization capabilities have been enhanced with the ability to visualize array data with a histogram, 2D plot, and 3D surface plot. 

·       Integrated memory debugging to show overall heap usage, locate memory leaks, detect misuse of memory APIs, and alert to any memory buffer overwrites.

·       UI and core debugger performance and responsiveness improvements. 

·       Numerous platform and compiler updates including Cray EX supercomputer, Rocky Linux, macOS Ventura (x86 and arm64), AIX 7.2, Python 3.11, and many OS version updates.

·       Bug fixes and security updates.

·       And many more features. 



With the addition of the enhancements above, is there interest in revisiting TotalView for the University? We would be happy to host an information session with TotalView’s key features and assist users with the tool and we are waiving the usual reinstatement fee/repurchase requirements until December 15th this year.



Are you open to exploring this option?

Thank you,

Lisa

Description : Hi RCHelp,

I’m reaching out to report this problem again: there is enough resource as requested, but the slurm system somehow cannot schedule it. This happened multiple times when our partition is busy. We understand this problem is hard to check when there is no specific examples. Just wondering is there anything you can help us to understand this situation.

My labmates and I noticed at least for two days, we cannot get d3168 where there is only one job running.

Thank you so much for your help!!

Description : Dear Research Computing Team of Northeastern University,

I'm Danish Mansoor, a freshly minted PhD candidate under the guidance of Prof. Auroop Ganguly, working at the Data Science and Sustainability Laboratory (SDS Lab). My need for cloud storage space is pressing, and I need your help to get it sorted. As I immerse myself in my research at the SDS Lab, the necessity for a secure, accessible, and expandable cloud storage solution has become glaringly evident. All the data I collect, and the post-processed research findings demand a dependable storage space. Cloud storage is the way to go.

I know that Northeastern University provides cloud storage solutions for students like me. I'm reaching out to initiate the process of setting up an account. I'm more than willing to comply with any protocols, guidelines, or requirements you have in place for this. Point me in the right direction, and I'll make it happen.

Your prompt response would be greatly appreciated. Please share any necessary forms or information required to expedite the process.

Thank you for your prompt attention to this matter. I look forward to your guidance.

Sincerely,

Danish Mansoor

Hello Sijia,

You are welcome! Thank you for letting me know. I completely understand preferring the terminal in certain situations. 

Is there anything else that I can assist with in getting setup or should everything be in place for your class?

Thank you,

Joseph

Dong :
RITM Update: reply from: s.dong@northeastern.edu

Thanks! I personally prefer the terminal when I want to demonstrate something quickly. OOD is a bit slow and navigating files can be a pain, but some students use OOD.

Sijia

Cooke :
Hello Silja, 

Thank you for letting me know that VMD launches with updating  XQuartz. As far as the items that get printed to the terminal, that is just VMD starting information that it isn't utilizing CUDA (which only would occur if you request a gpu node and load a version of CUDA) and information about available system memory and cpus too.  There isn't a means of quieting that print out to the terminal to the best of my knowledge.

Also from your screenshot, you are still on the login node so you will want to use srun to get to a compute node before running the VMD command.

Have you tried using VMD from Open OnDemand and would that work for your class or would the terminal be better for the classroom workflow?

Thank you,

Joseph

Dong :
RITM Update: reply from: s.dong@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

VMD launched after I updated XQuartz, but the terminal keeps getting the following:

[cid:07d3bf79-a401-4126-848b-33d0dae4ef92]

It doesn't affect the use of VMD, but it's very annoying because it keeps populating my terminal. What do you think may be the reason?

Thanks!
Sijia

Cooke :
Hello Sijia,

Absolutely! For the GUIs to launch locally from your terminal, you will need to have XQuartz installed on your Mac which will handle the X11 windowing environment. Then when you ssh into Discovery, you will need to include the '-Y' flag which will allow X11 forwarding to occur.  You will also need to pass the --x11 flag on the srun job as well to allow X11 forwarding too.

ssh -Y <yourusername>@login.discovery.neu.edu
srun --partition=short --nodes=1 --ntasks=1 --x11 --mem=10G --time=00:30:00 --pty /bin/bash

This is documented further on

https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/gettingstarted/connectingtocluster/mac.html#x11-on-mac-os 
https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/gettingstarted/connectingtocluster/mac.html#connecting-on-mac
and
https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/slurmguide/slurmrunningjobs.html#examples-using-srun

Have you tried to use OOD for VMD and the other GUI applications? X11 forwarding can provide a slower experience when using GUI applications on your local machine and using OOD uses a VNC connection which can provide a smoother performance.

Let me know if the X11 forwarding works with XQuartz and using the -Y flag.

Thank you,

Joseph

Hi Joseph,

I'm trying to launch GUIs directly from my terminal on a Mac. I've tried both Mac OS Monterey on a M1 and Big Sur on an Intel machine. However, they don't work. For example, on Mac OS Monterey, I typed "module load vmd", and then "vmd", but I get the screen below in my terminal, and no GUI has been launched. Could you help? Two years ago, it worked on my Mac OS Big Sur, and now it just simply doesn't work.

Cooke :
Hello Sijia,

I have added the students to the Gaussian group from the other ticket so they all should be setup now (from last week). 

Thank you for letting me know that the students can use the terminal or OOD to access the other software packages. For Tensorflow/PyTorch, I will check and see if we have an existing environment. I know we have an environment that we can clone that is for DeepLearning that we have both packages in so I will follow up when I get a little more information on that.

For scp, could you try it using the xfer node? I looked at the file tree and it looks like you have permission to write to that directory so it might be from the use of the login node for file transfer.

scp -p test s.dong@xfer.discovery.neu.edu:/courses/CHEM5641.202410/staff/s.dong

If that doesn't work, please let me know and we can dig deeper into this to find out why it isn't allowing you to upload files.

Thank you,

Joseph

Dong :
RITM Update: reply from: s.dong@northeastern.edu

Hi,

I need students to have access to Gaussian too. Could you add them to the gaussian user group? They need to complete homework using Gaussian and it is due on Tuesday.

Students can either use the terminal or OOD to access these software packages. Currently, I do not think we need more OOD applications. For Tensorflow/PyTorch, doesn't Discovery have existing conda environments?

One thing I have found is that I'm unable to scp files to the /courses folder. I tried
scp -p test s.dong@login.discovery.neu.edu:/courses/CHEM5641.202410/staff/s.dong

But it says, "permission denied". I'm able to scp to /home/s.dong though. Could you look into this permission issue?

Thanks!
Sijia

Cooke :
Hello Sijia,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. I am just reaching out to talk about your classroom request. For the software packages that you have listed, we have some already installed as modules on Discovery (Schrodinger, Gromacs, VMD, Mathematica, MATLAB) and we have Open OnDemand applications for some of them as well (Schrodinger, VMD, MATLAB). We can install Tensorflow and PyTorch in a conda environment for you as well. 

I just wanted to find out how you want to uses these packages so we can better assist in getting things setup for you. Are you going to have your student's ssh in through the terminal or the Discovery Shell access on Open OnDemand or would you like some Open OnDemand applications created for the course?

All of your students have Discovery accounts now and you have a storage space setup at /courses/CHEM5641.202410.

Thank you,

Description : Hi - 

I've been trying to run some analysis since last week that requires a large amount of memory due to the size of the data set. On July 21, the job was cancelled by SLURM due to a node failure on d0130. The job timed out running on d0129, so I re-wrote the job and restarted it, but since then its been stuck in the job queue, with a note that the requested nodes are unavailable. Looking at the queue , it doesn't look like d0129 or d0130 are in use by another user or marked as unavailable. I am wondering if there's something I'm missing or if you all have any suggestions.

Also, not sure if this is the right point of contact, but I recently had a paper accepted for publication and some of the analysis that was done in it used Discovery, so I wanted to say thank you all for your support:

Got it. Its not a rush, but I would like to try to finish this analysis by next week since its for a paper that I will be presenting starting in mid-August. My only constraint on resources is that estimation requires about 750gb of memory, so if there are other nodes that would work that's great.

Description : Dear RC Help,

My name is Bernardo. I am a postdoc at Northeastern.

In trying to transfer data from the Discovery cluster to Globus, I have run into a problem.
When going to the data manager and attempting to access the final endpoint of the transfer (my folder in Globus), I am getting the following message (see image attached). I can get access to the starting point in Discovery just fine.

I have tried several times throughout the day and still get the same problem.

Is this a problem on my end (something I’m not doing right) or is it a problem with Globus or the Discovery cluster in general? How can I get around this problem? Is there anything I can do about it?

Thank you very much!

Caplins :
Hi Marcus, 

Thank you for your detailed work on this issue. We have cleared up the messy permissions in the courses directory by changing the group assignment for the students directories. 

We will work on the two students who get the segmentation fault with the miniconda3/23.5.2 module. That's very strange and sounds like something in their /home may be interfering with that module....but why that module and not others is definitely puzzling. 

We'll be working on it. But it sounds like the students are able to do their work in the class with some modifications.

Cheers, 
Serena

Sherman :
I have encouraged the students to reach out. In my section specifically, it appears to have only affected two of my students: richardson.th and jonnavithula.u.

They are able to module load miniconda3/23.5.2. They are even able to create an environment for themselves (conda create -n bioinf6310 python=3.11.4).

The problem is whenever they try to use python. As soon as they invoke python from the command line, they get a segmentation fault. If they back out of their environment and use python, they get a segmentation fault again. I even had them delete their custom environments and re-create. Same issue. 

I inspected all of their permissions and the permissions of the upstream Python (/shared/centos7/miniconda3/23.5.2/bin/python), and there isn't any issue. But it is only caused when this specific module is loaded for these specific students.

If I have the student use module load miniconda3/2012-02 instead, everything works fine. I even have them use base python (2.7) without any modules loaded and it works fine (minus the outdated interpreter).

Furthermore, there seems to be some messy permissions or something in the course directory. The students don't/shouldn't have access to each other's directories, but it appears that a handful of students can freely access other student's directories. One example of this is connolly.rog. I haven't explored what other permissions these students appear to have regarding RW access in other directories like staff. I checked their groups and they are all appropriately assigned. I am at a loss here.

Caplins :
Hi Marcus, 

Are you and the students running the same scripts in the same environment? Is this impacting all the students or just some? 

If it's just a few students it may be something in the students environment. For example, if they have modified their .bashrc or built a different conda environment with a package missing (though conda usually takes care of this). 

If you could have the students reach out and make their own tickets we can help them resolve these issues on a case-by-case basis. 

I've looked at the permissions and everything seems to be set. With the settings as is, you don't have any additional permissions that the students are missing in regards to the miniconda3/23.5.2

Thank you, 

Serena

Hi Serena,

Thank you so much for your help. STAR worked out. I changed the paths in my R script and am running into the same issue. I was loading an R module when I tried to run with srun but I don't know how to run my script as it just seems to open an R interpreter. I am running into a few other issues, so I scheduled a consultation with you tomorrow at 4 pm. I will work on debugging things before then. Thank you for your help thus far!!

Caplins :
As for using STAR. I believe it should work if you do the following:

#get on a compute node first
srun -p courses --pty /bin/bash

#load the module
module load star/2.7.3a

#and then to use it make sure the command is in all caps
STAR

#it will output the message below
Usage: STAR  [options]... --genomeDir /path/to/genome/index/   --readFilesIn R1.fq R2.fq

To list all parameters, run STAR --help

Caplins :
Hi Isidora, 

Looking at your script you will want to modify the paths to omit the /work directory. 

The directory should be: "/courses/BINF6309/data_BINF6309/Module4/Annotation/transcriptBlast.txt"

The reason for this is that the courses Rstudio app "can't see" any of the /work directories. So it will tell you that it doesn't exist, when it actually does. 


Are you loading an R module when you try srun? We have R as a module that you can load with the command: module load R/version
You can see which versions are available with module avail R

We also have R available as a container image which is what you're using when you use the OOD. You can use these in the command line too but need to modify your srun command to run the Rscript through the container. 

This would look something like this:

srun -p courses --pty /bin/bash
module load singularity
#then to run the rscript
singularity run -B "/scratch:/scratch,/courses:/courses" /shared/container_repository/rstudio/rocker-geospatial-4.2.1.sif Rscript nameofscript.R

Using the container makes the most sense if you've been using the OOD to test the script.

Also be sure you have the necessary packages installed for the R script to run. 

I know this probably feels like a lot of information so feel free to book a consultation with me if you'd like more guidance or let me know here if you need more help. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Beslic :
reply from: beslic.i@northeastern.edu

Hi,

Thanks for getting back to me. I tried to run it with an srun command and then > R mergeKo.R and >Rscript mergeKo.R and several other variations of that, but was not getting any output. I then opened RStudio and that was working but I am getting an error message saying a file referenced in my script does not exist, but the file path referenced is complete and definitely does exist (I have gotten there through the command line). I can troubleshoot this with my classmates if you don't have an idea of what could be happening.

Another thing I was having issues with was star. I loaded the module and checked that it was loaded, but then when I try to use it, I get an error saying star is not a recognized command. Do you know what could be going on there?

Thank you!

Hi Isidora, 

How are you trying to run it? You could either make an sbatch script and submit it to the queue. Or you can try running it interactively with an srun command.

Let me know what you'd like to do and I can show you how.

hello ben-

thank you for reaching out to RC !

yes, you can download the modular cli, etc. 
while sudoers is not an option, you could build
a container with the modular stuff inside and 
run that on the cluster. 

lmk if you would like to explore that on your
own or have someone in the group pick it up.

i hope that helps
&& happy computing !

Cooke :
Hello Ben,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. There might be other ways to install and use Mojo on Discovery without you requiring sudo access. We do not allow users of Discovery to have sudo access so for software installation we recommend things like package managers, compiling from source with the prefix option, or using containers. 

For Mojo, I think the easiest route would be to containerize it because they even suggest that for mac os so it is possible to containerize. Do you require Modular and from the looks of it on their website it isn't released yet so how do you access Modular? Does this run on GPUs or CPUs? We just need a little more information about this to see how this would work and if this would be possible.

Thank you,

Joseph

Hi Ajit, 

We have a directory set up for your course at /courses/ALY6080.202415/

This has subdirectories for /staff /students and /data 
And has an overall size limit of 1 TB. Which we can increase if need be. 

We also have general apps included Rstudio and Jupyterlab notebook on the Open On Demand website under the "Courses" tab that you and your students can all access. 

For these apps and in the command line you can request to use one of two partitions,  "courses" for CPUs and "courses-gpu" for GPUs. 

Currently, we only have 12GBs GPUs for courses as GPUs are a limited resource. We recommend trying to configure your materials to the "courses-gpu" partition. If things are not working there please reach out and we can see if there are other options. There are 10 GPU nodes in "courses-gpu" so using mulit-gpus is an option. 

I will be sending you another email that has additional details on courses this semester. 

Is there anything else that you will be needing for this course? 

Cheers, 
Serena

if this is for a course, then we'll store that data in /courses,

additionally, we are managing filesystems for coursework
by default this year. ie, all courses hosted on discovery will
have space allocated to them (1TiB, but let us know if you 
need more) , etc.

Hi Vladmir, 

That sounds great. We'll just replicate the env you did your testing, with the pip installs in a conda env.

Thank you for the list of students. I've added that course and section number to our courses list. We will process it shortly and I'll confirm that the students are added. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Shapiro :
Hi Serena,

FFMpeg was week 1.

I appreciate your putting in your best effort. May I make a suggestion? If yes, could you make a condaEnv without FFmpeg and PDF first, to be on the safe side? This will take all the pressure off of the team, and you could continue to make improvements at your own pace.

Regarding the Fall B, the course was finally set up this morning.  Here is the CRN EAI6010.MERGED.71291.72035.202415. I retrieved the email list and will attach it (EAI6010.MERGED.71291.72035.202415_enrollments .csv).

Best,
Vladimir

Caplins :
Hi Vladimir, 

Can you remind me which week you use FFMpeg? 

We have a set-up that works for pycaret and pytorch and has PDF support and FFMpeg. I believe this covers Week 1, part of Week 2, and Week 3 (but correct me if that's not right)

The problem arises anytime your code uses tensorflow. Tensorflow is notorious for not playing well with other packages. And thus, as things stand, you may have pdf support for most weeks but lose it when you use tensorflow in weeks 4 and 5 unless we can get it to work in time. We are trying.

We can have as seamless as possible a set up for you. I will work on it this week and let you know when you can test it.

For fall B enrollment: are the students in canvas yet?

Shapiro :
Serena,

1. I get that the rest of the Fall A goals will not be attained, so I abandon the action plan below. Fall A section is over from the OOD perspective. No more deadlines.

2. Fall B starts on Oct 30th. Here is the plan B.
Replicate the environment that I prototyped during the summer. No FFmpeg :
It would be good if you can deliver  FFMpeg and  PDF support any time even after the course starts. :

Do you think it's attainable?

Also, I submitted a list of students for EAI6010 Fall B. I hope CRN will remain the same, etc. Is there anything else I need to do? I want to avoid scrambling at the very last moment.

Best,
Vladimir

Caplins :
Vladimir, 

We will not be able to get you anything for next week. When does Fall B start?

I think you still fail to understand the different applications available on discovery. You tested your scripts using system wide modules in the JupyterLab Notebook server. This is by no means a hack and how a lot of work gets done on discovery. There are no containers involved here.

What we are trying to build for your classroom is a containerized application in order to provide the print to pdf and ffmpeg. With these and other packages, which you had been installing into your .local with pip, the container becomes memory hungry and batch size is a problem. We are still working on why.

Shapiro :
Hi Serena,

the private notebooks aren't. :

Not sure I follow. Now the batch size and GPU memory are fine, and the culprits are the FFMpeg and PDF rendering support.

Let me suggest an action plan. We seem to have missed the week 4 window of opportunities. Not the end of the world. Can we have two separate condaModule4 and condaModule5 containers? The deadline would be either next Monday EOD, or the next Wednesday EOD. Would it be doable?  If not, I'm fine with the work to take longer but to have a clean classroom for Fall B, when I'm going to have another 30+ student class.

Best, V.

Caplins :
Hi Vladimir, 

Why not have the students repeat the steps you did to run the assignment? There are no pip installs in that assignment and the students all have access to the standard jupyterlab app just as you did. 

We ran into difficulties when we tried to layer in the other requirements you listed (print to pdf and ffmpeg) and now the container that we were building specific to your course breaks when we layer in all the packages for each week. Same with the conda env. 

I'm trying to make another conda env now but my test using the anaconda module that you loaded when you tested in jupyterlab also crashed in the container that has print to pdf. So more time is need to troubleshoot all the packages that you're wanting here. 

Might be time to pick what's most important. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Shapiro :
Hi Serena, thank you.

1, Week 4 tutorials are behind us. The assignment is the focus.

2, Please.

3. I also tried on T4 on Google Colab, which is 15Gb and it runs fine.

4. I tried to test my summer version which I would normally start from "JupyterLab Notebook" under "Servers".  It runs with no issues on 12Gb GPU, see the 2 screenshots attached. They show how I set up the instance and the run output (I just added "nvidia-smi" command to the script to illustrate the current GPU memory).  What am I missing? You should be able to access the session by Session ID: 55c3dc2c-993b-47e6-9ae9-34bb15afc6c8 in the logs.

Best, V.

Caplins :
Hi Vladimir, 

1. The week 4 tutorials run fine on 12GBs of memory. The assignment does not. It uses nearly all of the 32 GBs that we give it. It crashes on 12GBs. (the same thing happens on the tutorials for week 5).

2. We can make the container available to you to test it yourself. I don't know how you need to change the code. That is not for me to do. But maybe have it use a smaller dataset?

3. Shrug

4. This is inside NEU and on Discovery. It crashes on 12 GB. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Shapiro :
Hi Serena,

Thank you for the update.

1. Let's tackle one week at a time. If we have week 4 working, let's lock the container. We had dedicated ones for weeks 2 and 3; why would we not have same for weeks 4 and 5?

2. The code doesn't have  "batch" parameter. It should run one image at a time, then.

3. It runs on Google Colab with 16Gb with no problem. Colab doesn't have smaller than 16Gb to try on.

4. Based on my outside on NEU experience such tiny images and compact model architecture should fit on 12Gb just fine.

Therefore the question: are you 100% sure that the code wouldn't run on 12Gb GPU? I'm a bit confused since you said that you had a container that does run on week 4. Is it week 5 that breaks because of the insufficient memory?

Cheers,
V.

Caplins :
Hi Vladimir, 

I wanted to provide an update on where things stand for the EAI6010 course app. 

We currently have a container that runs the assignment for week 4, but that container breaks when we try to add in the packages that are required for week 5. We previously built a container that can run Week 5. 

Additionally, both of these containers require large memory GPU nodes (up to 32 GBs) to run without crashing. The courses-gpu partition is limited to 12 GBs. 

Thus, in order for these containers to be utilized in your course, and run on Discovery, changes need to be made to your code. 

For future iterations of this course we are happy to help you in preparing environments or we can build containers. However, some changes to the code will likely be necessary as we are unable to make a single container or environment that supports all the packages that you want installed. 

Let me know if you have any questions. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Caplins :
Hi Vladimir, 

I have tried rebuilding the conda environment twice now and still get the same error. It crashes at the training. When I search for other information on the error it suggests that the batch size needs to be reduced. https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/59578

I am not able to work on this anymore today. I will revisit tomorrow. 

Serena

Shapiro :
Hi Serena,

I'm onboard with the idea to have weekly environments. Can you have one for week 4?  By when? I have a lecture in 2 hours and need to announce whether the OOD can be used for the weekly assignment.

I care less about the tutorial, this I can show from the Colab.

please let me know.

Best, V.

Caplins :
Hi Vladimir, 

I am making an environment to just run the week 4 assignment. I think we have identified the packages that are causing the kernal to crash. Though why they are making it crash we haven't resolved yet. 

Despite what works in google colab, my colleagues who do ML for research confirm that it is atypical to have all the packages that you're using installed in a single environment.  I imagine you could test this in google colab by combing all of your notebooks in one instance and seeing if they run. 

I will update you later when/if I have an environment that runs the assignment. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Shapiro :
Serena,

I can confirm that "condaModule4" runs the tutorial smoothly.


The assignment script crashes, see the screenshot attached. I just ran on Google Colab and it ran with no issues.

Shapiro :
Thank  you, Serena. I'll check it probably very late tonight or tomorrow.

The assignment is really important.

Caplins :
The error I observed only appears in the assignment script. The tutorial runs without error.

Caplins :
Hi Vladimir, 

I have upgraded the version of protobuf in the environment and the packages are able to be imported. However, I now get an error: 

2023-10-09 00:29:10.922530: E tensorflow/core/grappler/optimizers/meta_optimizer.cc:954] layout failed: INVALID_ARGUMENT: Size of values 0 does not match size of permutation 4 @ fanin shape insequential/dropout/dropout/SelectV2-2-TransposeNHWCToNCHW-LayoutOptimizer

And I found another example of this error with some code that produces it and code that does not: https://github.com/tensorflow/tensorflow/issues/34499

Hi Meishan, 

For this kind of module we recommend installing it in a conda environment. If it needs to be installed with pip you can do so in a conda environment or in a python virtual environment and in either case we recommend using the command: "python -m pip install packagename" from within your conda environment or virtual environment. 

We have documentation for building conda environments on Discovery here: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/packagemanagers/conda.html#conda

Let me know if that all makes sense or if you'd like further assistance!

It looks like since we created new sub directories for REAP/ALERT and REAP/SENTRY we need 2 new collections to be created in globus, or one to be modified (for ALERT) and Created (for SENTRY)

The current collection,
alert_coe REAP SUBMISSION <https://app.globus.org/file-manager/collections/0b36b26e-f764-11ea-abce-0213fe609573>

Should be changed to link to /alert_coe/reap/alert/submitted/

And we will need a new collection for SENTRY which would be

Hi Greg, 
I wanted to follow up on the request for Globus access to encrypted storage neither Prof. Alicia nor me are able to transfer the data. Please update on this as soon as possible.

Pandit :
I am not sure if she also see the same thing when I try to transfer, the data.

Pandit :
"002487274@neu.edu" is my globus ID attached to h.pandit@northeastern.edu

Pandit :
Thank you greg, for for your response. I apologize, I meant to share  prof. Alicia's ID to the list for allowing her to transfer the data to encrypted storage using globus. I remember from our last discussion, you told me to share Prof. Alicia credential once she has created that , it would be great if you can add mine too.

Shomo :
hello hitanshu-

we should have stata configured with the dynamic partition
list early next week (if not tomorrow). that has just passed
testing and we only need to schedule updating the application.

i can not transfer the data for you (usualy, per DUA). that is 
something we can help with, but we are not supposed to 
actually "do".

please let me know if you would like to schedule some time 
to do this together. if i am not available, i am sure we can find
someone who is able to help you.

thank you !

Urgent Needed



----------------------------------------
Description : Hello,

My name is Helena Calatrava. My NUID is 002765852 and I am a PhD student under Pau Closas as a Professor Instructor.

I am writing this email because I really am in urgent need of a long partition. The current version of my code is not checkpointable. My request is  RITM4509991<https://service.northeastern.edu/nav_to.do?uri=sc_req_item.do%3Fsys_id=b13184dc874e7194878b0edc0ebb3576%26sysparm_stack=sc_req_item_list.do%3Fsysparm_query=active=true>. I really need this partition because we have a very important conference deadline in 5 days and I need to run the code for more than 24h. Next time I will spend the time trying to make the code checkpointable, but this time I really need this help, because the framework I am using is NOT checkpointable.

I really hope I can use the long partition, please let me know if I can do anything else to move forward with the petition.

[cid:image001.png@01DA01EE.D1645A30]

Thank you very much and I am sorry for the inconvenience,

Helena Calatrava

Shomo :
hello helena-

i've just setup a reservation for you on two (2) nodes (d0095,d0096)
for the next 5 days. these nodes are currently running jobs under your
account, so i also increased their timelimit from 1d to 3d. 

to use the reservation, please add the following to your jobscripts

#SBATCH --partition=reservation
#SBATCH --reservation=calatrava.h

and any timelimit such that the jobs finishes before 2023-10-24T06:18:24
should be just-fine.

please let us know if you have any questions
&& happy computing !

Pillai :
Hi Helena,

Thanks for reaching out to Research Computing.
If you need access to the long partition, you need to submit a ServiceNow Ticket.
https://service.northeastern.edu/tech?id=sc_cat_item&sys_id=0c34d402db0b0010a37cd206ca9619b7

Access is not automatically granted. You will need to provide details and test results that demonstrate your need for access for these partitions.

You can go ahead and submit the ticket. Just inform me on this ticket, and I can take the ownership of the ticket and provide you with the access asap.

Do let me know if you have any other questions.

Hello Maria,

Sorry for the delay in getting back to you. I just deployed the old Files application under the Interactive applications on OOD. It is under the HTML Viewer subcategory and says 'Home Directory'. Could you please test it and make sure it works.

Again, sorry for the delay in the response.

Thank you,

Joseph

Espana :
Hello Again Joseph, I know you told me that you are currently working to have this application deployed but meanwhile would it be possible to provide access to the sandbox to Madeleine Perko and Luke Sodemann? You have to start a project this Tuesday and would be great to have already access at least the three of us to work with these html files. 
Thank you in advance! 

Goretti

Espana :
Great, thank you Joseph.

Cooke :
Hello Maria,

Thank you for letting me know that it worked. We are currently working on a solution to have this application deployed so I will update you in terms of other lab members having access to it. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Espana :
Hello Joseph, it worked perfectly! Thank you so much for your help. I was wondering if you could do the same process for the rest of the lab members since we all are gonna use this html files eventually.  The lab members are Mark Nwakamma, Luke Sodemann, Madeleine Perko, and Jacqueline Caefer. Thank you so much in advance.

Cooke :
Hello Maria,

Thank you for clarifying. I just copied the Files application to your sandbox. Please test it and let me know if it is working and if you have any other questions.

Thank you,

Joseph

Espana :
Yes, exactly, the old ODD sandbox version to can view html files.

Thank you so much!

Cooke :
Hello Maria,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. What old app version would you like to be installed in your OOD sandbox? Do you want the Files application that can view html files?

Thank you,

Description : Hi,
I am planning to get COMSOL licenses (~ 5 seat) for our center (~5 faculty members) and potentially install it on Discovery HPC if possible. For this case, can we have job scheduling for COMSOL as well?

What kind of license will this require?

regards,
Ben

is next week OK. we are a still working hard
to get some courses up and running for this
semester (today is day-three).

[greg]

Davaji :
reply from: b.davaji@northeastern.edu

Hi Greg,
Can we have a brief meeting to discuss this please?

regards,
Ben

Shomo :
hello ben-

yes, there are a couple of groups that have
comsol licenses on discovery and they do
run comsol there. 

we do not, at present, gate jobs based on 
license availability for comsol, though. that
would be a new feature (and something i 
believe we can accomplish). we would need
to know your timeframe, though, which is
why i asked that explicitly. 

as long as you have a floating (network) license,
you should be able to run from a number of
including discovery compute nodes. :

you can manage the license-server locally or we
can put it on the cluster's license server. it basically
boils down to how much control you would like 
over the license server itself. we do not require
one answer or an other, so that part is up to you.

please feel free to call over if that does not
answer your questions. it's friday-pm and what
i believe to be a good-answer may not be ;)

[greg]

Davaji :
reply from: b.davaji@northeastern.edu

Hi Greg,
thanks for the response.

I believe Raphael told me, a while ago, there is an experience with COMSOL (one group has this setup) licensing with RC. Could you please check that. How the COMSOL is currently set up.

We need responses as soon as possible, then make decision on if Discovery is the platform we can use or we have to do a local server or a license server.

I will really appreciate any help to push this forward faster. Thank you so much!

regards,
Ben

PS. if needed I can connect you to COMSOL folks.

Shomo :
hello ben-

thank you for reaching out to RC !

we do not currently manage license access via slurm 
(our job-scheduler), but we can certainly look into it.
it is a feature in slurm, but it's not come up until now.

things are increasingly busy with the semester approaching.
what is your time-frame for this ? ie, this may be a september
thing for us (and not an august thing).

lmk && happy computing !

I am committed to dedicating the time and effort required to become proficient in working with the Discovery Cluster, and I am eager to contribute to any projects that may involve its utilization.

Description : Hi,
I have been using srun to allocate nodes for my computation using the following command -

srun --pty --export=ALL --partition short --tasks-per-node 1 --nodes 1 --mem=20Gb --time=24:00:00 --cpus-per-task=3 /bin/bash

A lot of such resources have been suffering from node failure which leaves my execution incomplete and delays my work by another day. This has been very frustrating and is wasting a lot of time, both mine and the node's. I have attached some instances of node failure. The issue has been happening consistently over weeks.

Please suggest any measures that I can take to slow down the chances of node failure and remedy any issues occurring on the nodes.

Hi Aditya,

Just checking in to see if you are still continuing to have the issue. If you want and due to the urgency of your work, we can setup a reservation for you for 3 days since your work suffered due to network issues on our side. Let us know and we can proceed accordingly.

Additionally, I would suggest you use the following srun command. This would get you a compute node faster. Sometimes, using --export=ALL has an overhead attached as it tries to bring the entire environment of the login node to the compute node. Also, it's not a recommended practice for executing workflow on a supercomputing cluster.  

srun --pty --partition short --tasks-per-node 1 --nodes 1 --mem=20Gb --time=24:00:00 --cpus-per-task=3 /bin/bash

Finally, if you want a faster execution of your program then you can try to utilize our newer d-nodes that you can get using the --constraint=ib directive in your srun command. This might make your job sit in the queue a little longer but will execute your job faster compared to the older c-nodes. Since you are training a model, it might be worth launching this job using an sbatch script instead of doing this interactively. 

If you would like to discuss your optimization options further with us, feel free to book a consultation using https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/

Description : Hi,

I am Ugur Kokal, a PhD student in the Mechanical Engineering Department, working under the supervision of Prof. Ozan Ozdemir. I have been running Star CCM+ simulations on the cluster. The version I have been using is starccm+/2021.3.1. However, my running jobs were unexpectedly cancelled yesterday around 1.00 pm due to a license error with the following message:

"Warning: Failed to connect to license server
Failed to reconnect to license server. Will attempt clean exit...
No connection to license server, unable to continue simulation.
Command: Automation.Run
   error: Server Error
No connection to license server, unable to continue simulation.
Command: Automation.Run
   command: CommandComplete
   error: Server Error"

Since then, I have been unable to run any simulations on the cluster due to the license error. I would greatly appreciate if you could check if there is an issue with the licensing of Star CCM+? I added also my batch code in the attachments.

Thank you for your help and time.

Best regards
Ugur Kokal
NUID: 511192130

Shomo :
hello ugur-

i've checked all the nodes your jobs were using and
they all seem to have good network configuration and
connectivity to the starccm+ license server. 

we did have to install a new gateway node (the powercut
killed our last gateway node), but we've been watching
it and have not noticed anything suspicious.

i've just added some additional bits in how we watch 
that gateway node, so please do let us know if you see
this problem again (and maybe we'll have some data on
our side to help out).

thank you for your patience 
&& happy computing !
[greg]

Shomo :
hello ugur-

thank you for reaching out to RC ! 

we just pass through packets for starccm+
to the license server that "they" run in the cloud.
i've just confirmed that this is functioning correctly.

can you please check again and confirm that 
it (doesn't) work ? 

thank you !
[greg]

Kokal :
Hi Greg,

I started my simulations after the power is restored again. However, I got the same error mesage regarding the license of Star CCM+. I am using version 2021.3.1.

Description : Hello,
I wanted to request ROCm 5.7.1 to be installed on the d3199 node, which has 2 MI210s.

The ROCm Docker container repository has instructions on how to add the ROCm RPMs to CentOS 7:

https://github.com/RadeonOpenCompute/ROCm-docker/blob/master/dev/Dockerfile-centos-7-complete

MAKE SURE THAT BOTH ROCM_VERSION and AMDGPU_VERSION variables are set to 5.7.1

Description : Hello,

I am currently using the A100 GPU node in ce-mri partition to train a DNN model. I noticed that the GPU speed is prety slow compared to the speed it should be (which it should be at least 2x faster than 2080ti but currently is 10% faster). I also checked the GPU clocks during training that is only 765MHz while the GPU utilization is already 99-100%. However, the A100 GPU clocks can be 1410MHz when boosting. I could like to ask if it is possible to enable the GPU boosting in the compute node. Thanks!

Thanks!
Ajay

Shomo :
hello ajay-

thank you for reaching out to RC !

your lab is currently using 35T, which is our
limit for free storage offered to PIs. you can,
of course, request more. it's just that every 
TB > 35 is charged back at-cost. in order to
set that up, we'll need to know how much
space you are interested in and there's some
accounting magick that i'll have to lookup
if you want to pursue this further. 

please let me know if you have any questions 
&& happy computing !

Description : Hi, I am wondering if a  sponsored account to our research group space can be restricted to only access one directory that is relevant to them? Thanks.

Shomo :
that works fine. i've just sent an invite. please feel
free to forward it as necessary.

thank you!

Li :
Stephen may not be able to attend, but another student and I can meet 2:30-3:00pm Friday afternoon. Does this work for you?

Shomo :
hello jixin-

this may prove difficult. can we meet up and 
determine a strategy for this kind of request ? 

the fundamental issues are the sub-directory and
the file-count. there may be some good-things we
can do to address these, but that is more typing that
i would prefer to do in a ticket. 

are you and stephen available to meet sometime
friday afternoon ? 

[greg]

Li :
Thanks Greg. The path to the directory we want to share with collaborators is /work/mhealthresearchgroup/sci_jitai/. They already got an NU ID and should be set to be only allowed to this particular directory in the group space and no other directory.

Shomo :
traige

Shomo :
hello jixin && thank you for reaching out to RC !

technically, "yes" ,this is possible. depending on the
exact location of that directory, though, that may be
easier or more painful to accomplish.

can you share which path you would like to share
with which account ? 

then we will be able to provide a specific answer, 
as opposed to a theoretical answer.

thank you !

Hi Bill,

Sure, you can restart a single Desmond simulation to continue from where it stopped or to extend the length of the simulation by using the checkpoint (.cpt) file. Please refer to this link (https://www.schrodinger.com/kb/1883) for the commands required to use checkpointing. Do let us know in case you have more questions. 

Thanks,

Hi Hrishikesh,

Yes, that's true, I only need 1 GPU but with access >8hr.

I am not aware of that. Can you assist me on the checkpointing? The resources from Schrodinger software is not really helpful on this issue.

Best regards,
Bill

Pawar :
Hi,

Thank you for reaching out to RC with your request. It looks like you have requested for just 1 GPU under a multi-GPU partition request. I wanted to confirm whether that is your requirement or it's an error. 

If you need access to a single GPU for 24 hours, you could try using checkpointing or multi-job array on a single GPU partition, in that case you can run a longer job within the 8-hour window available to a single GPU partition. Have you given this a try?

Thanks,
Hrishikesh

Hi Joseph,

Thanks for the update.

By the way, our lab was just told that we need to remove JAMF from our computers in order to be compatible with the NEU system.  Can you confirm that this is true?  Unfortunately, this software is necessary to access the WI VPN (and in my case, the hospitals where I work).   I don’t know what we can do.

Best,
Kate

Cooke :
Hello Kate,

My apologies on the delayed response. We are working on getting things setup for the data transfer to occur over Globus for Wallace and Rob. Again, sorry for the delay in getting things up and running for this to occur.

As far as your sponsored account goes, you should be getting a student email address and be able to setup a Discovery account with that one. Sponsored accounts primarily are for researchers who are not directly affiliated with Northeastern and need access to Discovery (think collaborators) or are student workers within some departments and need to keep things separate from their student account. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Higgins :
reply from: ka.higgins@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

Sure thing!  But we really, really would like to get this moving ASAP.

By the way, I was just notified that it’s time to create my NEU sponsored account.  Can you let me know if I’m currently writing to you from my permeant account or some sort of temp account?  What’s this about a second account?

Best,
Kate

Cooke :
Hello Kate, 

I haven't connected with Rob or Wallace just yet. We are trying to get one last thing setup to make the transfer a little easier. I will reach back out later today or tomorrow with the status of it.  Sorry for the delay in responding to your inquiry. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Higgins :

Hi Joseph,

How goes it?  Have you been able to connect with Rob and Wallace?

Best,

Cooke :
Hello Kate, 

My apologies on not having yourself and the others included on the ticket. I have added everyone to it so everyone should be getting email updates. I will check into the procedures and requirements for Rob and Wallace to get onto Globus and start the transfer of data to Discovery. I will also check on the progress of your /work directory getting setup as well.

Thank you,

Joseph

Higgins :
reply from: ka.higgins@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

I don’t think I’m on the new ticket — Jing-Ke had to forward this to me.  Would you please add me?  It’s probably also wise to add the Whitehead globus transfer team, Rob and Wallace (I’ve added them on the cc line).

Just to recap, we will be transferring about 190TB of data from several different directories.  I do not believe there is a home directory set up for the Weng Lab yet.  We’ll also have to find some way of adding Rob and Wallace to Discovery, since they will be the ones initiating the data transfer (not me).

Many thanks,
Kate

Hi Joshi,

As Jing-Ke, says we have been trying to initiate a globus transfer of about 180-200TB of data since mid July.  We were in frequent communication with Greg and Joseph until early August, when they abruptly stopped responding to our messages.  I was just notified that our former ticket has now been closed.

Would it be possible to loop in Greg and Joseph so that all of our work until this point can be used?

Thanks,
Kate

Weng :
reply from: jingke.weng@northeastern.edu

Hi Joshi,

There have been multiple meetings and significant amount of prep work done between Northeastern IT and Whitehead Institute for this in the past months. Greg Shomo and Joseph Cooke were involved in the discussion. We just had a hard time getting a response from them since six weeks ago.

This is a digital data transfer from server of Whitehead Institute to Northeastern in the context of my lab move. I believe that Globus is the tool to be used.

My student Kate Higgins (cc’ed) is overseeing this data transfer from our end with IT support from Whitehead Institute.

Best,
Jing-Ke

Description : We are working on a research project for a Khoury affiliated club and would like to host a PostgresSQL database on Research Computing, would you be able to help us do this?

Bhagat :
Hi, 

1. Only northeastern students will be accessing so nu-only should be fine. 
2. A minimum of 100 gb of storage would be required, but up to 500 gb would be nice to have. 
3. Backups aren't required, but if it would be easy to implement and not cause difficulty reading/writing to Postgres then could be helpful to avoid data loss. 
4. I think a year would be a good length of time since I imagine our club would like some of the data we store to be kept for a while. 

Let me know if you have any more questions and thanks for your help!

Shomo :
hello vedant-

there are a couple of standard questions for folks who 
want to host a database in RC. 

1. who requires access (eg, cluster-only, nu-only, whole-world)
2. how much data 
3. backups required ?
4. longevity of project (semester, year, decades)

i'm sure there are others, but those are the most-significant
to see if hosting the database will be a good fit.

thank you !

Hi Greg,

Hope you are well.

I am writing with a request to enable a weblink type sharing (i.e. a link that I can use to share data on Discovery storage with collaborators). We are using s3 right now to share data which is becoming expensive.

Could you please help?

Hello Miten,


Even though deploying a web server in the cluster is straightforward, exposing the data to the outside world is not that trivial. Due to the complexity of Northeastern's firewall. I will work the the sysadmins team and give you an update on this request.


Thank you,
Surya

Jain :
reply from: mi.jain@northeastern.edu

Hi Surya,

Thank you for trying to assist with this. The ssh requirement will not work for sharing with outside collaborators. I also do want a semi static link to share and host data longer term and some of those cannot be deleted. 

This is what I wanted a public html directory through which I could symlink a shared directory with data. 

Is that something we can explore?

Best wishes,
Miten

Periaswamy :
Hello Miten,


I tried setting up ngrok to establish a tunnel for data transfer. But unfortunately, Northeastern's firewall seems to be not cooperating with this. I have to conduct a couple of other tests to come to a conclusion on what might work. Also, I was wondering if you would be fine with using SFTP for file transfer, It is similar to HTTP but it would be using SSH for the file transfer, it's a lot easier to set up.


Thank you,
Surya

Hi Surya,

That sounds very promising. Please keep us advised.

Thank you for helping with this.

Best wishes,

Periaswamy :
Hello Miten,

I'd like to share a straightforward method for making your data on Discovery accessible via a web link. You can achieve this by setting up a local web server and utilizing an HTTP tunnel to extend this access to the internet.

One potential approach is to use the python3 http.server module to launch a local HTTP server within the directory you wish to share. Following that, you can employ HTTP tunneling software like ngrok to enable external internet access to your data. However, it's important to note that the exact configuration can only be confirmed after conducting some tests.

I'm currently in the process of running these tests to ensure the setup functions as intended. I'll be sure to provide you with an update once the testing is complete.

Thank you,
Surya

Periaswamy :
@Shomo, Greg,  I remember using the SimpleHTTPServer module from python and ngrok to run a local server and expose that to the internet securely. Might be handy in this situation.

Jain :
I mean let's work on a longer term solution. I can kind of make things work for now via AWS, but it would be useful to have a simplified channel to do this.

Thank you Greg. The data don't need to be protected. I just want to make public links to share/host.

Shomo :
hello miten-

sorry, what does "semi-urgent" mean exactly ? 
this is not a service we offer today, so this is 
a bit more than a casual "just hit return" moment ;(

if you need to share some subset of data, that would
be helpful to know. maybe we can setup an adhoc server
for this. 

is the data publicly available ? need it be password 
protected ? 

sorry if you have answered those questions in the past.
it's been hectic and i do not pretend to remember many
details.

thank you !
[greg]

Jain :
reply from: mi.jain@northeastern.edu

Thank you, Greg. The timing is semi-urgent as I have a lot of data to transfer that are currently being shared via AWS.

I am also happy to test out things in beta if you'd like 🙂

Wan :
RITM Update: I said team meeting doesn't work!

Cooke :
Hello Quan,

A zoom call would work as well. I just got caught up on. the ticket.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Quan,

Does a Teams meeting work? I am available at 11:15 this morning.

Thank you,

Joseph

Wan :
RITM Update: Can I schedule a zoom meeting with you at 11:15?

Wan :
RITM Update: Hi Greg, I cannot take teams call. I don't have laptop from northeastern and I cannot log in teams from my full-time job's company

Wan :
RITM Update: Hi, can you look at the comments from past several days? What you have done about uncompressing folder is helpful. But there are other problems. It is been so long for this ticket. Can we zoom at 11 am?

Shomo :
RITM Update: hello quan-

i believe we fixed this up recently, but can you please confirm ? 

thank you 
[greg]

Wan :
RITM Update: Hi, do you have any feedback? My students are waiting to finish their homework.

Wan :
RITM Update: Hi, I don't see RStudio for binf 6309 under courses. Can you point out? Where shall I check BINF6309 course application for RStudio on OOD?

Cooke :
Hello Quan,

We have a BINF6309 course application for RStudio on OOD. Could you check and make sure all the R packages are installed in that application that you require for your class. It is from the last time the course was offered.

Thank you,

Joseph

Wan :
RITM Update: Can we meet again?

Wan :
RITM Update: Hi Paresh, I don't understand where do you want me to check?

Chheda :
Hello Quan,

Can you please check if the BINF 6309 has all the pre requisites and work for your classroom. The app has almost all the packages you might require for the class.

Best,
Keval

Chheda :
Sure. Here is the invite link -https://northeastern.zoom.us/j/91004146986

Wan :
RITM Update: Can we have a quick zoom meeting?

Chheda :
Hello Quan,

Can you please let me know the steps you are using to access the data. We have set the permissions correct, just need to debug why you are facing the error. 

Best,
Keval

Wan :
RITM Update: Yes, I did launch it but it didn't let me access the /work/courses/

Chheda :
Hello Quan, 

'Rstudio :

Best,
Keval

Wan :
RITM Update: Hi Greg, I log into OOD. I am confused which application I should use. Can you make a screenshot for me? Thanks a lot!

Shomo :
RITM Update: hello ! 

i may have just fixed this up for you, but please do confirm
once maintenance is over. 

additionally, please confirm which OOD applications you 
are using. there is a new default Desktop application up 
at the top of the Courses menu that you should use (and 
not the application you see under Bioninformatics heading.

we changed lots of course-related configuration over the
summer, so it is good to verify.

thank you !
[greg]

Wan :
RITM Update: Hi Greg, I see your update this morning. I really appreciate your help on this. I checked the /work/courses/BINF6309 folder. They are all good from discovery ssh terminal. But I still cannot access this path from BINF6308/9 RStudio. Do you know why?

Shomo :
RITM Update: i guess there were not that many files, 
as they are already copied back ;)

please take a look and let us know if
this works for you.

[greg]

Shomo :
RITM Update: hello quan-

i am untarring this now and will try to make this 
available at the older location. 

i will be out a few hours this morning, but those
files are being un-tar'd as we speak.

[greg]

Wan :
RITM Update: Hi Greg, I am not sure if you work today. Can you give me some feedback when you are back?

Wan :
RITM Update: Because we have template script for students, we have canvas module, there are lots of places I need to modify if you change the path.

Wan :
RITM Update: Hi Greg, is that possible we untar the archive to old path /work/courses/BINF6309/?

Shomo :
RITM Update: hello quan-

we have migrated all course directories to /courses, so the location
for this course-work will be /courses/BINF6309.202410.

if you would like, i can untar the archive to /courses/BINF6309.202410/data,
but please confirm.

[greg]

Wan :
RITM Update: Unfortunately, second issue is that we used to store data for a module under /work/courses/BINF6309/. Now it is moved to /work/courses/TO_BE_ARCHIVED/BINF6309/. I originally edit couples of places in my course content and then I realized there are a lot of more places I need to change. BINF 6309 will retire next year which means we only need these data under /work/courses/BINF6309/ last time. Is it possible to change from your end to make data available in the old path again? I really appreciate your help!!!

Wan :
RITM Update: Thanks so much for working on my ticket on Sunday! The student list is for BINF6309.12300.202410 and BINF6309.12301.202410 both. At the beginning of the semester, I thought all of my students already took BINF 6308, so they have access to Discovery and I didn't request classroom for them. Until this week, we found from BINF 6309 RStudio we cannot access files under /work/courses. Is this because I didn't request classroom for them? I cannot access it any more either. Thanks.

Wan :
RITM Update: Hi Greg,

Shomo :
hello quan-

thank you for reaching out to RC ! 

is this for BINF6309.12300.202410, BINF6309.12301.202410, 
or both ? just checking before we go typing, etc. 

thank you !

Description : Hi,

I just wanted to check in on the status of powering up the Discovery Cluster. Our lab (Speech and Neurodevelopment Lab; Zimmermanlab) hasn’t had access to our files this week. When we attempt to open the folder “zimmermanlab” in ood it says, “no such file or directory.”

Please let us know if this is still in progress or if we should have access now.

Shomo :
hello ken-

this was a well-known and documented possibility last year.
this year, it's a real issue. at root, the proxy we use for compute
nodes to talk to the internet is over-busy. there are two (2) fixes
for this, both of which we intend to implement (once we are 
done with our current project). they are:

1. upgrade hardware in proxy server
2. provide new proxy server for research. ie, you know your 
code will be doing something and there is no reason for it to 
compete with student coursework, etc. 

#2 allows us to scale horizontally, if we must, but i'll be surprised
if that is required. it's mostly "high-talk traffic" where ai-bots are
doing stuff "live" from the cluster. 

in any event, it's on the list. sorry it's getting in your way now.
can you survive a couple more weeks ? 

[greg]

Hi Greg,

That sounds good to me, can we go ahead and increase the quota?

Thanks!

Sara Rouhanifard

Shomo :
hello sara-

thank you for reaching out to RC !

we have not yet finalized the price per TiB per year
for this academic year. it will go up a bit from last couple
of years, where that price was $141/TiB/year.  i 
think we are look at something around $154/TiB/year.

if that sounds fine to you, we'll just update your
group's quota and send over a "here's how to get
additional storage" message that includes the
account to which funds should be transferred.

please let me know if you have any other questions.
we are relatively casual about this, so if that sounds
good to you i'll update your quota today and we'll 
figure the rest out once the price is set.

let me know ? 
[greg]

ps. the price is literally cost passed through, so while
it is "just math", we have not shared that with the
advisory committee yet (and would prefer to do that
before committing to it in public).

Hello Turner,

Please let me know if there are any updates on this ticket.

Thank you,
Surya

Periaswamy :
Hello Turner,


I have a couple of questions to delve deeper into this issue. After examining the SLURM output, it appears that a prevalent problem is related to:

"OFI get address vector map failed."

One possible reason for this could be that the node you ran on did not have Infiniband enabled. To address this, I recommend trying the "--constraint=ib" SLURM flag when requesting nodes with Infiniband capabilities. Additionally, have you considered using the "fi_info" flag to obtain more comprehensive information about the nodes you are requesting? It might also be beneficial to experiment with alternative MPI implementations, such as OpenMPI.


Thank you,
Surya

Periaswamy :
Hello Turner,


Thank you for reaching out to RC. I am looking into your issues, I will get back to you with updates.

Description : Hello,

I have a deadline for a conference next month and I am trying to expand the dataset I am using located in /work/yanzhi_group. When I started I kept getting out of allotted space errors. I have since freed up around +200 GB of space, which should be more than enough but now the error is returning after expanding my dataset by only by 80 GB.

I am not going to have a paper if I don't have this data. And I do not understand the source of this error.

How much space do I have allotted, why is it seemingly changing, and how do I apply for more storage now?

Thanks,

Tim

Rupprecht :
perhaps definitionally a pathological case. I will encourage folsk to archive things not in use. :

Shomo :
hello tim-

thank you for reaching out to RC !

there are two (2) parts to the quota:
1. disk-usage
2. number-of-files

currently there are over 24M files at /work/yanzhi_group

# df -i /work/yanzhi_group/
Filesystem                              Inodes    IUsed IFree IUse% Mounted on
vast1-mghpcc-ib.neu.edu:/work_project 23599280 23599280     0  100% /work

while we can increase that number for you, this suggests that
the group is using the filesystem to store millions of small files,
which is the pathological case for large filesystems.

i'll increase the file-count to 30M, but please do make an effort
either by tar'ing and zip'ing things :
up or by deleting what is no longer necessary. if this is not
possible in your environment, then let's setup a meeting to 
figure out a safe path going forwards.

thank you
[greg]

ps. file-count quota now at 30M

Description : Hi,

I am new faculty here at Northeastern (Chemical Engineering + Chemistry & Chemical Biology) and part of your research is high performance computing.

Prior to starting at Northeastern, I had a conversation with Raphael Schroter and I had been given an estimate of that $5k per year would make the facilities available for me including computing time. I am currently working with two computational programs


  1.  CRYSTAL (https://www.crystal.unito.it/) - atomistic modeling software
  2.  COMSOL (https://www.comsol.com/) - continuum modeling software

I am in the process of re-acquiring these licenses, but I also wanted to follow up as to how I get to purchase time on the cluster, get the codes installed or connect IT with the technical support of these different codes.

Thank you for your time and I look forward to hearing from you.

Damilola Daramola

Daramola :
Greg, 

Let's lock it to our group for now and if someone else requests access I wiould be okay with that.

A colleague of mine mentioned that ITS (or someone) can help fund additional license or provide some subsidy/cost match for certain software. Is that accurate? The specific scenario would be a case where I would want to purchase an additional license for COMSOL and maybe ITS provides some percentage of that cost and thus the license then becomes available for others to use with 2 licenses.  
I would be interested in that opportunity if such a model existed.

Dami

Shomo :
that's interesting (as we already have some comsol licensing
on the cluster). in any event, i should ask if we have to lock 
down access to 'crystal' to your group or if it is OK to leave
that "open". 

just crossing T's and dotting I's. 
[greg]

Daramola :
Greg,

Thanks for the update. I will keep that in mind if I have other uploads. Guess I was testing the limits of the system ha!

I am waiting on the legal side to accept the terms and conditions and then I will be able to place the order and download the files. 

Dami

Shomo :
hello dami-

apologies for the delay. i was out a couple of days and
am just catching up.

thank you for attaching the binaries to the ticket. next time,
if it is easier, just upload them to your home directory on 
the cluster and i can copy them over. i didn't know that
SNOW could handle such large uploads ! 

in any event, i just untarr'd the binaries you provided and
will get someone on-team to setup a modulefile for you to
test those out.

any news on the comsol bits ? 

[greg]

Daramola :
Hi Greg, I wanted to follow up regarding this request. Would you prefer I upload the CRYSTAL23 versions that are newer? I had not heard anything from you based on our prior discussions. Dami

Daramola :
Hi Greg,

Daramola :
Greg,

Great. I am working with the COMSOL folks on a new license. 

In the meantime, with respect to CRYSTAL, I currently have CRYSTAL17 and I am attaching two sets of files (along with the list of other possible files) which I thought may closely represent those you pointed to. In addition, the installation instructions from the developers are provided here https://www.crystal.unito.it/include/manuals/CRYSTAL23_installation.html. I remember years ago, I simply ran .\Pcrystal and could run although I am not sure I took full advantage of the parallel architecture in that manner. 

I have access to discover now too.

Dami

Shomo :
hello dami-

all RC servers run linux, so please choose "linux" for the comsol bits.

the crystal question is a bit puzzling, tbh. we do run Linux AMD64,
so that's a good start. next, we run CentOS-7 (today, at least), but i 
only see mention of Debian10. i wonder if there is a source download,
as i see the phrase "can be generated", but it's not clear to me what
that choice is named. 

i guess i would try to download these four (4) bits, if that is an option:

crystal23_v1_0_1_linux-ifort21.4_pdistrib.tar.gz
crystal23_v1_0_1_linux-ifort21.4_mppdistrib.tar.gz
crystal23_v1_0_1_linux-ifort21.4_pdistribomp.tar.gz
crystal23_v1_0_1_linux-ifort21.4_mppdistribomp.tar.gz

let me know if that helps. if it doesn't we may need to spend some time
figuring out how crystal talks about things.

happy computing !
[greg]

Daramola :
Greg, 

Thank you for following up and for all the information. 
1. Great to know that the initial service is free until I reach a certain threshold. I was essentially trying to get a sense of what it could cost if I got past the free stage and needed to purchase time. I was trying to get a sense of number for when I was negotiating my start-up. Anyway, it sounds like we can cross that bridge when we get there if we burn through the free stuff quickly.

2. I have requested a discovery account and will let my incoming student know to do the same too. 

3. For COMSOL, I do plan to purchase 2 seats and want to restrict it to my research group. I am waiting on a quote for COMSOL and we have been using the windows version in the past. Is there a preference for the OS version  of COMSOL to request?

4. For CRYSTAL, I currently have the license for CRYSTAL17 and I can download the different versions of that software, but I think I would need to know what architecture/compiler is closest to what is available at the university. Any suggestions based on this list:  https://www.crystal.unito.it/supported_architectures.html

Thanks again and I look forward to working with your team.

Regards,
Dami

Shomo :
hello damilola && thank you for reaching out to RC.

first off, welcome to NU ! i'm not quite sure what you and
raphael were discussing, so let's start here : 

access to the public partitions of our HPC system (discovery) is free.
you do compete with others at the university for time, etc, so folks with
greater computational requirements sometimes purchase private 
servers for the cluster and othertimes they purchase 'allocations', which
are dedicated cpu or gpu hours. these are not once-in-a-lifetime 
decisions, so we suggest folks start with "all the free stuff" and see
if that meets their needs. if not, we'll have some data to move on 
from there.  

we also offer storage on the HPC system, which is free-of-charge for
the first 35T and then charged back (at cost) for usage beyond that limit. 
i believe the cost for this is ~$156/TB/year, but we have not finalized 
the FY24 prices yet. 

wrt licenses for comsol and crystal, we do not have these generally 
available. while a couple of groups use comsol, most only update every
5y or so due to the cost and those licenses are very limited (often 1 seat)
and restricted to their research groups. i don't think we have anyone 
using crystal on the cluster at present, but it looks to be unix and hpc
friendly (which is a good thing).

i don't know what looked to be $5k when you were speaking with raphael,
but that may have been the crystal license (which looks to be 3,000EU
for the basic + mpp upgrade). maybe that was it ? 

just let us know when you have the licenses / install media for comsol 
and crystal and we can get those bits setup for you. 

if you do not have a discovery account yet, may i suggest getting that going
by following the procedure at https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/first_steps/get_access.html.
you may also want to request some space for you and your group, which 
is alluded to in the "Work" section of the Data Storage Options page at
https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/first_steps/get_access.html

that's a lot for one message, but please feel free to reach out and schedule
a meeting, submit more tickets, whatever works best for you. we are here
to help, but we are not great at mind-reading. anything you can do to help
us make your computational life better will be much appreciated !

thank you
&& happy computing !

RITM Update: reply from: e.piza@northeastern.edu

Hello,

We have agreements in place with the agency, but have not submitted to IRB yet. We're still figuring out some aspects of the project, and won't have the analysis plan finalized until then.

We won't need the server space until after we're set up with IRB, so no big rush at this point.

Thank you for checking in.

Description : Hello,

I am a former member of Dr. Jornet's group and because I graduated my account has become an alumni account and lost access to my files and access to Cluster.
To get access again and continue the research work, we requested the sponsored account, and a new account was created.  a.amit@northeastern.edu

Current status:

  *   While I can log in to the Discovery cluster dashboard with this new account.
  *   I can't access the unlab partition files.
  *   I can't start the COMSOL session.


Best regards,
Amit

Caplins :
Hi Amit, 

Are you all set with COMSOL here now?

Cheers, 
Serena

Caplins :
Hi Amit, 

Your new account does have access to the unlab, can you try accessing that partition again?

 You weren't in the comsol unix group. I have added you to comsol. This should take affect in ~2 hours. 

Please let me know if that works for you,

Description : Hello,

I noticed that these days it takes quite a long time for resources to be allocated when requested from the Discovery Shell. I tried several times since yesterday and it took me 30 minutes at least to wait for a response. I don't think this is normal because in the past it usually took at most 5 minutes.

Best,
Mia

Shomo :
hello mia-

thank you for reaching out to RC !

we have been running at 100% utilization 
most of this week, so you are absolutely
correct that it will take some time to allocate
resources for a new job. 

at this very moment, for example, there is 
exactly one (1) node idle in 'short'. that's about
 :
people must be busy.

i assumed you were talking about partition
'short', but do let me know if you are trying
to work in a different partition, etc.

thank you for your patience
&& happy computing !

Description : RC team,
I just wanted to let you know of some unusual behavior, which may be misuse (though I may be misunderstanding the output).  I noticed that many short partition nodes are in a mix state, yet single-core jobs are waiting to start. The job requests 2G of memory and 1 core, and some nodes appear to be able to handle this.  Below is an example.  What I find odd is that the node is not fully allocated, but the CPU load is much greater than the allocated number.  Something may be wrong with the node/job, and that is why our job can not start. It looks like this node should have about 90G of memory and 2 cores available.

@Cooke, Joseph, see https://www.notion.so/nuits/Page-on-Gromacs-performance-9a52daebb06241d9813ae6c1053f60a2
We might need to do some Gromacs performance to evaluate this better. I was dealing with a similar issue with Keramati Masoud but didn't really get a response back.

Cooke :
Hello Paull,

I am just reaching out to see if this issue is still occurring for Michael in terms of seeing low job throughput. Just looking to see if I can observe it happening in real time in the queue to try and determine what might be happening.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Paul,

Thank you for letting me know that it was just a test and I completely understand not being able to recall the given state of the machine the time. Is the issue still occurring for Michael where low job throughput is still happening? It is potentially easier to track down when the problem is actively occurring as to why a job might not be launching.

Thank you,

Joseph

Whitford :
reply from: p.whitford@northeastern.edu

Unfortunately, since that was a while ago, I can't say exactly what was happening with the machine.  This specific submission was just a test.  Michael has had very low job throughput for the last 2 weeks.  We thought it might have been that he was asking for too much in a single submission.  So, he submitted a 1-node, 1-core request and that also would not start.  There were more than 1000 cores idle.  It looks like the schedule is not launching jobs, even when resources are available.

thanks

Cooke :
Hello Paul,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing and sorry about the delay in responding to your inquiry. 

Looking over the output you shared for the job in question it is marked "Priority" so it looks like slurm hadn't considered running the job at that moment. One of the possible causes of this is if Michael had other jobs running or pending at the time and slurm just hadn't considered the job in question yet based on those factors. Does Michael recall about how many jobs he had submitted at the time or if he had other jobs running during the time as well? 

Looking over Michael's submit script, it looks like 4 threads were requested in the launch of GROMACS but in the resource request it was 1 task and a blank statement for cpus-per-task which defaults to 1 so the job failed.  We can meet and talk about the job submission as well just to understand the workflow better.

Thank you,

Joseph

Description : Hi IT team:

Per the conversation we just had with Greg Shomo, Keval Chheda and Serena Caplins,  we can move forward with 2 unix groups (as I understand it) that will control permissions for the work/postresearch folders.


Group 1:
postadmin (or whatever you all decide to call it) should include:
Brady Post (just me)
And should provide read/write access to all folders and subfolders of postresearch.


Group 2:
Then, the other group (postresearch or whatever you decide) should entail
READ ONLY to postresearch/data_raw and
READ/WRITE to postresearch/Shared and all subfolders

Here is the list of people that should be in Group 2:

Farbod Alinezhad
Nasim Ferdows
Steve Flaherty
Alexandra Harris (Northwestern U)
Asa Hartman
Sophie Lin
Danielle Maestas
Narcissa Plummer
Aseye Potakey
Isabella Ratto
Jennifer Rosen
Ngoc Thai
Ziyue Wang


Kindly let me know if you have any questions.

Hi Greg,

Appreciate it. Looks like some privileges got lost in the transition. Farbod and Ngoc, CCd, have lost access to the Shared folder.

Could you please restore their access and send me a list of everyone who is in each group?

I would also be glad to manage this internally if you are able to give me the rights to do it (although I understand this may not be available yet).

Shomo :
hello brady-

i think we are pretty close to having this setup now. 
fwiw, the two (2) unix groups are

postresearch-admin: b.post
postresearch: $everyone_listed_below

i can chgrp, etc the bits below Shared, 
if you would like, but as the top-level /work/postresearch
is now well-protected, that is not required. 

please let me know if you have a preference
&& happy computing !
[greg]

Shomo :
ok, so looks like we have already done this (sometimes that happens). there is currently the unix groups 'post-ro' and 'post'. i've just added all the right people top post-ro, but that doesn't seem like quite enough. 

i am going to rename the groups to 'postresearch' and 'postresearch-admin'. this is not arbitrary, but as we move forwards with standardization, we'll want the group names to match the research project names (and the directories beneath /work). 

this may well require a one-time change of ACLs, but i'll pay that price for cleaner configuration in future.

Shomo :
@Caplins, Serena not yet, but i have that tab open.

Caplins :
@Shomo, Greg is this ticket all set?

He may need to request a cluster account. CC Steve flaherty

Caplins :
Hi Brady, 

Realized I can just pull from the current ACLs that we have set up. Still would be good to confirm.

So here is what I have for group 2 just listing their usernames: 

alinezhad.f
n.ferdows
st.flaherty
ale.harris
hartman.a
lin.sop
maestas.d
plummer.n
potakey.a
ratto.i
rosen.je
thai.ng

For Ziyue Wang I believe they should be: wang.ziyue1
but there is also wang.ziyu1
and wang.ziyue7

The first two Ziyue Wangs are on the cluster but wang.ziyue7 is not. 

Cheers,

Thank you for the lists. Do you mind adding the email address of each person in group 2? I started to do it and ran into duplicate names so we need to be sure we add the correct person. 

Many thanks!

Cooke :
Hello Emma, 

Sorry about the delay in getting back to you. We can definitely setup a meeting up (including the PI for the /work directory) to discuss this further. The main idea would be creating two unix groups. One that would have the full access to the /work/cnelab/ directory (read, write, and execute permissions which is the standard) and then a read only (read and execute permissions) group for the entire /work/cnelab/ directory.  

This will make additions to the /work/cnelab/ directory easier in the future based on the permissions the PI wants the researchers to have to the directory. 

Also others have reached out about setting up read only access for /work/cnelab/ for students. Do you know if it is all for the same students or there will be multiple groups collaborating on this?

Thank you,

Joseph

Tinney :
reply from: tinney.e@northeastern.edu

Hi Joseph,

They would only need access to a couple folders. I am more than happy to set up a meeting about this.

Cooke :
Hello Emma,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. It is possible to create a group such that they will have read only access to the entire directory. We should schedule a meeting to discuss this because depending on the size of the directory (number of files) it may take a while to set up these permissions. Would they need read only access to the entire directory or would they need to have write access to certain parts?

Thank you,

Joseph

Description : Hi, I am trying to run the MaxQuant software I was talking about, and it uses the XGBoost algorithm within it. I am getting a System.DLLNotFound error in the middle of the process. I am thinking that maybe i need to load some Visual C redistributables? You can find the full error at: /work/slavov/Orhun/maxDIA_Test/errReserve.txt

Kok :
The program by default uses XGBoost, I don't think its meant to be modifiable by the user. So the XGBoost references were not added by me.

Cooke :
Hello Orhun,

Thank you for letting me know that. Do you have a copy of the file before you added in the XGBoost references or can I just comment out the XGBoost references?

Thank you,

Joseph

Kok :
mqpar_rep2.xml has worked before on the cluster up to the point of the XGBoost error.

Cooke :
Hello Orhun,

Thank you for trying out that potential solution. Sorry to hear it didn't work.

Could you share an example of a *.xml file that you have used previously successfully? I am in the process of trying to containerize mono with the prerequisite libraries and would like to know if I have captured everything in the container and then work on debugging the XGBoost addition. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Kok :
I've tried doing the VSCode interface process you suggested and I'm getting an illegal instruction error when I run mono on MaxQuantCmd.exe & mqpar_rep2.xml .

Hi Orhun,

Our team has started working on the container for Mono but we are running into issues that we are still trying to diagnose. In the meantime, I was wondering if you could try the following option instead?

1. Go to https://ood.discovery.neu.edu/pun/sys/dashboard/batch_connect/sys/vscode/session_contexts/new

2. Fill out the form with any random password that you can remember to be used again in a couple of minutes

3. Once the VSCode interface opens up, on the left-most panel, click the 3 horizontal lines and select Terminal

4. Once the terminal opens up, load the gcc & python modules followed by activating Spack and running mono on MaxQuantCmd.exe & mqpar_rep2.xml 
to see if it works or not and let me know the results.

I am getting this error: 

.NET Core 3.1.100 needs to be installed. Please visit https://dotnet.microsoft.com/download/dotnet-core/3.1 and install the SDK x64. 


It seems that it missing some dependencies.

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Orhun,

I meant the error after you run the command: sbatch mono-run.sh

Once the mono-run.sh script runs, it should produce slurm output file with the $JOBID.o and $JOBID.e files. You should submit this script from the location that has your MaxQuant exe and other necessary files needed to run the program.

If that doesn't work, then we'll have to look into building the container from scratch.

Kok :
I can't find the error output, I don't know where the script has outputted it to, could you let me know where I can find it?

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Orhun,

The container image I had shared with you is the official image by Mono, so all those dependencies should be there. Could you share the error you are getting at your end or is it exactly the same as what I got? 

I'll look into their Dockerfile to see if anything else could be identified otherwise we'll have to start with building a brand new container with mono as the base image and add xgboost assembly file along with other dependencies there.

Best,
Manasvita Joshi, Ph.D.
Data Scientist,

Kok :
I have not found a workaround and have tried what you suggested and it is failing for me too. The slurm script I had before loaded some required modules like python, dotnet-core, and gcc. Are these within the Singularity container?

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Orhun,

Thanks for the update and apologies for a slow response. Are you still encountering this problem or have found a workaround?

I took a deeper look at the error and it would require us to install a system-wide library or have the entire installation available to you as a container to get around the issue. Seems to me that the xgboost assembly file error is cropping up only when you have XGBoost instance enabled in your mqpar_rep2.xml file. 

Given that you've installed mono using Spack and it doesn't give an option to install the xgboost assembly file as a dependency of mono, we'll have to think about other ways to get this going. I found out the official mono container on Docker Hub that I would like you to test to see if it works for you.  See https://hub.docker.com/_/mono/

I've copied the container using Singularity on /shared/container_repository/mono
The folder has the container image, mono_latest.sif, and also a batch script to run the container. You can submit this script using: sbatch mono-run.sh 

I'm encountering an error when I try to execute the container and I'm not sure if that is happening because of some additional files that might be required for mono to run a Maxquant executable or if something is missing from the container environment itself. So would like you to test that out at your end and let me know if you are also encountering the same problem. Following is the error I'm getting:

=========================================
[m.joshi@c0244 mono]$ singularity run --cleanenv --bind "/work:/work, /scratch:/scratch, /shared:/shared" /shared/container_repository/mono/mono_latest.sif mono

If you confirm that you are also encountering the same error after ensuring that mono has everything it needs in its environment to run a MaxQuant executable, then we will have to look into setting up a container for you with a spack installation of mono and xgboost assembly library installed inside the container.

Let us know your results and we'll go from there.

Yes I am using the slurm script in  /work/slavov/Orhun/maxDIA_Test. The output is called test_maxDIA.out and the error file is err.txt. I've ran it again on the short partition and the error is still the same it seems to be a system dll error relating to XGBoost.

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Orhun,

Apologies for the delay. I took a look at your error file and it is difficult for me to diagnose as to what might be causing it. 

Are you using slurm_script.sh located at /work/slavov/Orhun/maxDIA_Test to launch the program when you receive this error? The slurm script was utilized when the reservation was active. Are you facing this error while launching on the short partition as well? Some more details on how the program is being launched would help figure out the error.  

From whatever I could find, the error could be due to some dependencies not being found in a shared location, may not be entirely due to missing visual C++ redistributables. In that sense, it would be helpful to learn what script is being used to launch the program. Based on that I can start looking into the DLL files location to ensure that they are where they are supposed to be.

Thanks. We're going initially to use a commercial neural network called trainYolo. This network has a Jupyter notebook, which I'm attaching here.

This is the type of workflow that we will start doing at first.

Then, I'd like to run another type of neural network for image classification. This one is called a Variational Autoencoder, and details of the notebooks can be found in this repo.

Cooke :
Hello Joydeep,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing. Thank you for letting us know that the documentation on RC help isn't too clear on the slurm job arrays. I will take note and bring this up to the team. We have a training session on slurm job arrays recorded on our training page (https://northeastern.instructure.com/enroll/LNNCHN) and here is a link to our github (https://github.com/northeastern-rc/training-slurmarrayjobs/tree/main) that provides the examples and resources for the training session which might be helpful to get a little more knowledge on the area.

Looking over your script, could you please try changing the following line:

python ContractionMap_v10all.py --label $array

to 

python ContractionMap_v10all.py --label $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID

because $SLURM_ARRAY_TASK_ID is the variable that will run from 250 to 350 from how you set your array index in your sbatch directive:

#SBATCH --array=250-350%50  # 50 is the maximum number.

How you have it set though, it will run 50 jobs at the same time if there are resources available to run them so if the results from the previous run is required for the next script you will have to change how many jobs can run at the same time.

Do you have any other questions?

Thank you,

Joseph

Hello Ben,

Apologies for the delay in response. The workshop content looks good and we should be able to cover that in 2-3 hours. November would be preferable so you can discuss that with your team and we can finalize the date closer to the workshop.

Thanks,

Eck :
reply from: eck.m@northeastern.edu

Hi Paarthvi, thanks for checking in! We'd like to have the workshop this semester ideally, but flexible on exact timing. We already have a professional development workshop planned for October, so maybe September or November would be good? Are there a few dates in there that could work for you that I could propose to the rest of our group?

As for topics, our audience will be engineering PhD students, so I think the focus should be geared at a high level towards how graduate students can apply version control to their work, with some hands-on demos for folks to get familar with the tools. This seems like it might be a 2-3 hour workshop?

On the technical side, everyone should be pretty familiar with programming. The CLI might be a little intimidating to folks, so I think it would be best to focus on the desktop app, and mention that there's a CLI for folks who want to get a bit more advanced. In terms of specific topics, here's a rough draft of an outline:

Why use version control?

  *   saving code in the cloud
  *   ability to roll back changes and safely try new features
  *   collaboration
  *   using and contributing to other projects

What are all the tools, and how do they work together?

  *   web-based github
  *   local git CLI and git desktop

What types of files work well with Git?

  *   text-based vs binary files

How do git and GitHub work?

  *   key vocab terms: branching, committing, forking, merging, cloning, remotes vs locals,
  *   walk through an example workflow: cloning a remote repository, making a new branch, committing a change, merging back into master, resolving a merge conflict

Hands on portion

  *   I think a good way to structure this would be working throughb common scenarios a grad student might encounter. These could be:
     *   I want to use some open-source code in my project, how do I clone and start using this repository?
     *   I have a bunch of code that I've written for my research, how can I start using version control with it?
     *   I want to try a new piece of code in my project. How can I use git to commit the change, then roll it back if it doesn't work?



Thank you!

Thanks for getting back to me Paarthmi! What I had in mind was that our department could host the event, i.e. book the room, get some refreshments, and Research Computing (or some other northeastern resource) could actually deliver the presentation or workshop.

Sharma :
Hello Ben,

Thanks for reaching out to RC with your request! 

Just to clarify you would want us to host a workshop or would a member of your department host/deliver the session and any particular resource is required from our end.

We have hosted workshops in the past but they are generally related to Discovery use cases. Once you clarify the above requirement, I can check with the team internally and let you know if that's something RC can help you out with.

Thanks,
Paarthvi

Description : Hi,

I recently transferred my sponsor to Dr. Sijia Dong last week but I don't have access to her /work directory (/work/donglab). This is for the account with user ID palle.a. Are there any extra steps I need to take to get access to this directory?

Thank You,

Hello Adithya,

You are now added to the donglab partition and will be able to access files inside /work/donglab. Please let me know if you need any further help.

Hello Sijia,

Hope you are doing good. I have got the request from Adithya Palle (palle.a) to add him to the /work/donglab directory. I would request you to approve this request so I can make the changes accordingly.

Description : Good morning,

In the Discovery restoration, our access to our encrypted files (Crookes work encrypted) has not been restored.  This would be for myself, Salome Goglichidze, and Wanjiang (Lucy) Wang.

Data analysis is ongoing and needs to be restored as soon as possible.

Thank you!

Description : I am currently outside the country. When I want to use a VPN to SSH back to the research computing cluster, the GUI program experiences significant latency through X11 forwarding and is virtually unresponsive.

Hello Peiyuan,

Thank you for sharing those results. Your internet speed to the data center is definitely effecting your experience of using Discovery with or without the VPN. As far as connecting to the university's remote window server or a virtual machine based VMware Horizon, that is not something Research Computing has access to. If you want to submit a general ticket to customer support at Northeastern, they maybe able to help connect you to the team that can assist with that.

Do you have any other questions that I can assist with? Can I resolve this ticket?

Hello Peiyuan,

I am reaching out to see if you were able to run the speed test again with or with out the VPN (the opposite of the first time you ran it) to see what the results were.

Thank you,

Joseph

Cooke :
Hello Peiyuan,

Thank you for trying that out. The speedtest, was that with or without the VPN? Could you try it using the opposite that you did the original test with to see the speed? As far as getting access to wvd, that will be something you will need to submit a general support ticket and find out about because we do not have control over those resources.

Hi, I cannot access wvd.northeastern.edu Via both RDP and VMware Horizon.
Please check if it's because I do not have access or the way I used was wrong.

Cooke :
Hello Peiyuan,

Thank you for testing your connection speed. Do you have access to wvd.northeastern.edu? You should be able to access that site without the VPN and it is a windows virtual desktop connection.

Cooke :
Hello Peiyuan,

Thank you for reaching out to Research Computing and sorry about the delayed response to your inquiry. You do not have to use the VPN to ssh into Discovery or to use Open OnDemand. The VPN will not make the connection any faster and can slow it down in some situations. 

Could you please run a speed test for us (http://speedtest.rc.northeastern.edu/) and let us know the results? This is a speedtest to the datacenter so we can know what your connect speed is to Discovery. 

For a windows remote desktop, do you have access to wvd.northeastern.edu?

Dear Vincent,

Actually, things work OK.
But since I am abroad, the high latency of X11 forwarding makes me unable to use the GUI program which runs on Discovery(our research computing).
I believe using a remote Windows Desktop which is physically within the campus will greatly help.
If we have any accessible remote desktop resource, please let me know.

formally, the answer is "no, jobs were not canceled".

every running job was killed. jobs that were queued

Description : To Whom It May Concern:

The Coastal Sustainability Institute (CSI) and Department of Marine and Environmental Sciences (MES) are presently developing a collaborative MOU with the Gloucester Marine Genomics Institute (GMGI). Our partnership involves research collaborations between CSI and GMGI scientists as well as independent research projects. We will be soon initiating the process of creating Visiting Academic Appointments for GMGI scientists interested in this collaboration. As part of our goal to build out this collaboration, GMGI scientists would like access to MGHPCC computing resources. They will of course pay appropriate fees and follow MGHPCC policies but I wanted to confirm that such access will be possible. Please advise and thank you!

hello geoff-

that sounds like an exciting collaboration and research
computing would support this in any way we can. there 
are no fees to use the discovery cluster at mghpcc, but
there are limits (both storage and compute) to the shared
resource pool. 

that's getting us down into the weeds pretty quickly, 
though, so let's leave it at "yes, this is possible (and 
encouraged)" and we look forward to this collaboration.

make any difference to the answer, but it's always good to have
an idea as to what the future holds !

please let me know if you have any other questions

Description : Hello Tim,

Sorry for the issues. Do you know if it’s the gunicorn server running on port 8502 or 5901? I can’t find the one on port 8502 but I am also running something on 5901. The 5901 one I will need for another hour until my experiment is finished logging results. After that I will start to use compute nodes for these servers.

Subject: discovery cluster notice
hello yu.calv-

You're running gunicorn on login-01, which is a bit computationally heavy for the login node.
Is it okay for us to kill this process?

Happy Computing

Rudenko :
Hello Calvin,

I apologize for the delay. 
Do you have time for a consultation this week?

Thank you,

Also, is there no way to run a server without a compute node? I didn’t know it was computationally heavy.

Description : hello combine-

thank you for your patience as we setup 
the two (2) new L40 gpu nodes in partition
'Minkara_COMBINE_Lab'. these machines are
now racked, installed, and configured for
discovery.

as the machines are very new (both in default
hardware, GPUs, etc), we went with a slightly
newer distribution (rockylinux-8) as the base
installs. that may mean that some of the older
modules available on discovery do not work on
these machines. please do let us know if / when
you come across these and we can update them
for you.

a few other groups have been running this 
configuration for a few months now and the 
growing pains have been minimal (one or two 
things each).

let us know if you would like to setup a meeting
to discuss this in more detail, but i suspect 
that you'll be fine (#FamousLastWords). 

thank you again for your patience
&& happy computing !

Description : Hello,

We use Discovery to host a computational model and online platform for public-facing research. We had a workshop yesterday afternoon where we tried to access the URL<https://dev.foraai.rc.northeastern.edu/> for the project, but throughout the day the page did not load . There were no issues listed on the ITS status page and our IT contractor looked at it and didn't find an issue on their end (see below). We can schedule around planned maintenance, but we really need to know if the system is going to be offline. Do you know what might have happened yesterday?

Thanks,

hello dean-

it's always a good practice to let us know in advance
for presentations, etc. that way, we can be prepared
if there is a problem.

next time, please call my work number 617-363-5066,
which forwards to my cell at 617-797-4664.

apologies. we thought it was up ('cause it was) and were
not checking reachability. we are adding that test in later
this week.

Massey :
Hi Greg, thanks for that explanation. If we have a similar problem in the future, if we reach out is there a way to get the server back online quickly?

Shomo :
hello dean-

thank you for reaching out to RC ! 

there was an unplanned power-cut over the weekend
and while foraai was up, the server running the service
came up without network. consequently, foraai was 
un-reachable (which is a lot like down) until early this 
morning.

sorry about that. i think you should be OK now,
but please confirm.

thank you

Pawar :
Hi,

I'm glad to hear that you could test for scalability.
Please note the following next steps:
You can verify performance improvement when using multi-gpu by testing with 1, 2, 3 and 4 GPUs, and see what type of speed up you achieve with each. Also, do make sure that your code is optimized to handle multi-gpu setup while testing out the framework.

For each scaling test that you perform, you can calculate the parallel efficiency for each number of cores N. This is evaluated as:
Efficiency = (time required on 1 core)/(N*(time required on N cores))

An efficiency of 1 indicates perfect (i.e. strong) scaling. As a goal, this number should be over 0.8 when using all cores on a node
Note: If scaling efficiency is low (<0.5) when using the maximum GPUs selected on the general partition, request will be declined.

Finally, once you complete testing on the multi-gpu reservation access and are able to show that your application scales (speeds up) across multiple gpus, you would need to open a post-testing access ticket here:
https://bit.ly/NURC-PartitionAccess

Also, please make sure you provide the location on Discovery where the tests are, when applying to the post-testing access.

Do let me know if you have further questions.

Thanks,
Hrishikesh

Hi,

I have run a test successfully on multi-GPUs for example, please check and contact me if you have any questions.

Pawar :
Hi,

I've created another multi-gpu reservation for you on a multi-gpu node with 4 p100 GPUs, starting 18:30 on 10/10, lasting until 10/12, 18:30. Please try testing your script again and reach out to us if you encounter an error. Also, please note that it is not required for you to run long simulations or on a full data set, this is just to show that your application is able to scale on multiple GPUs compared to a single GPU, so you can use shorter calculations to save you some time.

Thanks,
Hrishikesh

Long :
reply from: long.qu@northeastern.edu

Hi,

I just run a simple example for testing, but when I try to run “ srun -p reservation --reservation=image_process --partition=multigpu --gres=gpu:p100 --nodes=1 --mem=10GB --time=02:00:00 --pty /bin/bash” for allocating resources, it popped up the error “srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: User's group not permitted to use this partition”.

Could you give me more time to troubleshoot or you could help me out with this problem as soon as possible.
Thank you so much!

Best,
Quanjiang Long.

Pawar :
Hi,

I've created a multi-gpu reservation for you on a multi-gpu node with 4 p100 GPUs, starting 14:30 on 10/06, lasting until 10/08,  14:30. I can extend it more if needed. Also, please note that it is not required for you to run long simulations or on a full data set, this is just to show that your application is able to scale on multiple GPUs compared to a single GPU, so you can use shorter calculations to save you some time.

To see reservation information, type:

$ scontrol show reservation=guoy_optimizer_test

To use the reservation, simply add the following:

1. If running an interactive job, to allocate all 4 GPUs for example, type:

$ srun -p reservation --reservation=guoy_optimizer_test --gres=gpu:v100-sxm2:4 --time=24:00:00 -N 1 --pty --export=ALL /bin/bash

2. To submit your jobs to the scheduler, add the following lines in your sbatch script:

jsx
#SBATCH -p reservation

#SBATCH --reservation=guoy_optimizer_test

#SBATCH --time=24:00:00

#SBATCH --gres=gpu:v100-sxm2:4

Additionally, for reservations, you can use the following to see your running jobs:

jsx
$ squeue -u li.guoy --all

$ sacct -S now -u li.guoy

Let me know if you have any additional questions!

Thanks,
Hrishikesh

Hi,

Yes, that would be working for me. But I didn’t see the update on the services page, could you send me the meeting link if possible.
Thank you so much!

Pawar :
Hi,

We can provide multigpu testing access for you using a 24-hour or a 48-hour reservation on a multigpu node. The p100 GPUs are all currently occupied and we can only offer a reservation within the next couple of days, as those nodes become available.  Please let us know the convenient time frame for your reservation get started for you. Would 10/06/2023 14:00 onwards work for you?

Thanks,

Hi Joseph,

We can connect anytime on Wednesday, Thursday, and Monday between 11 am to 5 pm.
Please let me know what time suits you best and we can schedule a time to meet.

Thank you,

Thanks for Update Joseph.
I wanted a server that can be used by multiple users like we have our RC servers:

Cooke :
Hello Mital,

I just installed Mage AI with pip and used the OOD Desktop (Beta), which has Firefox in it, so I could source activate the environment from the terminal inside of the OOD Desktop and have it open up Firefox to show the interface of the application.

This is being hosted on the compute node and you can request more CPU cores on the compute node to have it run the processes in Mage AI. 

Would a solution like this be suitable? Have everything run on one compute node from withing the OOD Desktop application. 

Thank you,

Joseph

Bhanushali :
RITM Update: reply from: bhanushali.mi@northeastern.edu

So I need to run a python package that will require a server to host it.
https://docs.mage.ai/getting-started/setup here is the detailed link for this tool.

So once I install this package using pip, I need a server that hosts Mage application so that I can access this application using the server URL.

Regards,
Mital

Cooke :
Hello Mital,

There are two different versions of the Desktop on OOD. The account question on the Discovery (xfce4) OOD application, you can leave the account field blank and it will submit successfully. 

The Xfce Desktop (Beta) OOD application is a containerized desktop and it runs just as the normal desktop but has extra applications built into it. 

Both of these desktops, you can open up the terminal application inside of the desktop and you can source your conda environment. Our documentation on building conda environments can be found here https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/software/packagemanagers/conda.html.

When you say that you want to use it through the localhost IP, do you mean the localhost IP of the compute node that you are running on or the localhost you are connecting from? 

Please let me know if you have any other questions that we can assist with.

Thank you,

Joseph

Bhanushali :
RITM Update: reply from: bhanushali.mi@northeastern.edu

What do I mention in account there? While launching Desktop ?
Also I wanted to use this Mage AI after pip install through localhost IP. This is needed to set up jobs that we might need to run periodically. So I am just wondering if that is possible through desktop

Regards,
Mital Bhanushali

i just responded to your teams-message, but here's
pretty much the same-thing in SNOW.

thank you for the link, that was very helpful in coming
up with a plan for you here,. 

personally, i think the easiest thing to do would be
to start an Interactive Desktop job via OOD, install
mage-ai via pip (as per the docs) and continue on from
there. 

please let us kmow if you have any questions

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Mital,

Thanks for providing this additional information. 

The short answer is that it could possibly be arranged for you to access the port. However, we would need to know where is this localhost located, on your laptop, one of the compute nodes on Discovery, or one of the VMs that's assigned to your group? It might be best to book a consultation with Greg Shomo sometime this week or next to go over your requirements so that he can figure out a way to give you access, if possible. You can do so using https://rc.northeastern.edu/support/consulting/

Hope that helped. Let me know and I'll close this task accordingly.

Thanks for reaching out to RC regarding this. Apologies for a tardy response as we are currently understaffed.

While I get started on looking into your software installation request, I wanted to clarify if you are facing issues with accessing  sc-investigation.rc.northeastern.edu but have managed to install the software based on the instructions provided on https://docs.mage.ai/getting-started/setup

Title : Unable to access Discovery Cluster through Sponsored Account
Category : General Computing
Description : 
 Hello, 

 I previously had a sponsored account with the username: singh.arj with Dr. Josep Jornet, professor, ECE. He also renewed the sponsor account for me with the username: ar.singh, at the end of May.

 The primary purpose of the account is to be able to utilize the OnDemand Portal for Discovery Access. 

 However, I have been running into a host of problems and I would be very grateful for help. 

 With the username of singh.arj, I have the following: 

  1. I have all my work stored in Discovery with this username (work/unlab/singh.arj)
  2. I can access Discovery through SSH, but not OnDemand
  3. I was informed by RC help that the account is currently not included in the database queried via the LDAP protocol, which OOD relies on. 
  4. After reaching out to ITS for help, I was told that I should claim the new sponsored account (ar.singh)

With the username ar.singh, I have the following: 

    1. I don't seem to have permission to access OnDemand or even SSH into Discovery. 
I am sure that I was provided with this access when the sponsored account was created. Is there something that I should ask my sponsor to check? Is there an issue on the backend? At this point, I am not sure what I should do to be able to merge the two accounts, recover my work, and be able to use OnDemand for Discovery access. 

I would be very grateful for your help in the same. 

Regards,
Arjun

Hi Chengyu,

Could you please provide a few job IDs to Surya?

Surya, I understand that you would like to help us. However, as a computational chemist in this area for nine years, I always need long partition for different types of calculations. Splitting one quantum mechanics calculation to multiple quantum mechanics calculations (probably can be done with checkpointing) will seriously affect the efficiency of our work. If you are interested, I would recommend that you learn quantum mechanics, density functional theory, and the implementation of those theories in general. Hopefully that you can give us access to long partition soon.

My postdoc, Manish Kothakonda (m.kothakonda@northeastern.edu) also requested access to long partition. Please also give him access. Thank you.

Best,
Qing

Even though checkpointing is not straightforward in VASP, It appears you can use DMTCP with a plug-in to checkpoint VASP (https://www.vasp.at/forum/viewtopic.php?t=18208). I believe the MANA project is a project from NERSC. Could you please let me know if you have tried this approach?

Hi Nishat, 

Looks like they need to be unzipped and it's looking for an index file which may be in the .zip file. But you can check the manual here https://github.com/alexdobin/STAR/blob/master/doc/STARmanual.pdf

I dont see the genome.zip in your script 

I see now (your updated message). Yes I would unzip it.

Hi Nishat, 

We have star installed on Discovery as a module. You can use it by running the following commands:

First go on a compute node
srun --partition=courses --pty /bin/bash

Load the star module
module load star/2.7.3a

Use the star command (with the module loaded you should now see the usage options)
STAR
Usage: STAR  [options]... --genomeDir /path/to/genome/index/   --readFilesIn R1.fq R2.fq

Hi Jess,

I checked with our devs, and this particular group still has an old 'admin_only' invitation policy set on it. Such a policy is no longer available for assignment, but old groups that had this policy before it was deprecated still have it until an admin changes it. You'll want to reach out to a group admin and ask that they change the invite policy for the group to be 'this group's managers & administrators', after which managers should be able to send invitation for the group as well.

We'll go ahead and close out the ticket. Please let us know if you should require additional support on this matter.

Caplins :
Hi April, 

Not to my knowledge. But we have many applications on the Discovery computing cluster which has several versions of anaconda installed. These allow you to create conda environments and can be used in Jupyterlab notebooks or Rstudio on the Open on Demand website.

You can see what we have on the Discovery cluster here, which includes getting access: https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/2.0.0/01_welcome/01_welcome.html

Is that what you're looking for?

Description : Hello,
I was in the binf6309 course. I launched my rstudio. The rstudio doesn’t recognise this path when it is actually there:
/work/courses/TO_BE_ARCHIVED/BINF6309/
But when I type this is normal terminal the file exists.
I don't understand why rstudio says there is no directory called as courses in work directory.
I had to copy these files to my working directory for the program in r to work.
Pls give me more clarity.

Caplins :
Hi Meghana, 

Just touching base here. I've cleaned up the permissions a little. But to clarify, using the RStudio under the courses tab you can access the path:

/courses/BINF6309.202410/

And this will now also work:

/work/courses/BINF6309.202410

However, the TO_BE_ARCHIVED directory is only open to members of research computing. Was there something specific you needed there?

Cheers, 
Serena

Caplins :
Ahh I see. Are you enrolled in a course this semester? The courses Rstudio is a new app that's only open to students from this semester. 

We'll work on changing this so you can access it next week. In the meantime transferring files via the terminal sounds like a good work around.

Dropathi :
I am using binf6309 rstudio . But it doesn’t recognise paths .rstudio under courses I can’t access that

Dropathi :
But it says I can’t use rstudio under courses . I can only use the one under binf6309

Caplins :
Hi Meghana, 

Thank you for contacting RC with this issue. 

Which Rstudio app are you using? 

I think the problem is that the Rstudio app is running through a container which has some discovery directories bound (or "visible") to it, but not all and which paths are visible depend on which app you're using. 

If you're using the RStudio under "Courses" it should work. However if you're using the general Rstudio app under "Interactive Apps" it won't be able to see anything in the /courses directory. 

Note the path /work/courses/TO_BE_ARCHIVED .... is a symbolic link. The actual files live in /courses/TO_BE_ARCHIVED. But in either case the /courses directory will only be usable with the "Courses" Rstudio app. 

I just tested it and if you're in the courses Rstudio app, and I am able to set my path to /courses/TO_BE_ARCHIVED/BINF6309/  

Does that make sense? I realize this set up is a little complicated and appreciate you pointing that out with this issue. 

Cheers, 
Serena

Description : Hi, I work for the Sound Mind Collaboratory as part of the Psychology Department at Northeastern University. We have an interest in getting access to the Discovery high-performance computing system. One of my colleagues had mentioned that lab-wide accounts can be created for the system, which is something we are interested in. I see on the documentation how I can create an individual account for myself using my NE credentials, but how do we go about setting up a lab-wide account where multiple users can access it? Any assistance on this is appreciated. Thank you!

hello mark-

i am going to resolve this ticket, but please do 
let us know if you have any other questions.

hello mark-

we should be pretty-good in that area. if not, 
please let me know where we let you down and
we'll do our best to fix things up !

Thanks, Greg. Mainly, we have numerous users in our lab and we may need multiple people to access the system and add or remove files from data storage, submit jobs and more. Looking over the data storage documentation, at least, it sounds like we can use access control to give access to data to other users. So, as long as we can, essentially, share jobs and data across multiple accounts, I think we're fine. Thanks.

Shomo :
hello mark && thank you for reaching out to RC ! 

that is inaccurate and all accounts on discovery must map back to a
northeastern community member in good standing. 

what were you hoping to address using a service-account
for the lab ? there may be other mechanisms available such
that our "must be a human" requirement is not in-play.

i look forward to your reply
&& happy computing !

Hi Oyeronke, 

It looks like everything is set up for you at:

/courses/BINF6310.202410

I see the three students in the students sub-directory and I see you have a directory under /courses/BINF6310.202410/staff

We have miniconda3 available as a module. You can use it after running the command from a compute node:

#first access compute node
srun -p courses -pty /bin/bash

module load miniconda3/23.5.2


Is there anything else that we can help you with?

Cheers, 
Serena

Hi Helena,

Thanks for reaching out to RC with your request. We've added you to long partition. 

# groups calatrava.h
calatrava.h : users long

To run jobs on the long partition, use the Slurm flag --partition=long.

Thanks,
Paarthvi

Calatrava :
RITM Update: The current version of my code is not checkpointable, and I really need this partition because we have a very important conference deadline in 5 days and I need to run the code for more than 24h. Next time I will spend the time trying to make the code checkpointable, but this time I really need this help, because the framework I am using is NOT checkpointable.

Calatrava :
RITM Update: I am trying to use the long partition and I cannot do it. It says I still have no access to it.

Calatrava :

Description : Good Morning-

I'm having trouble accessing discovery. I submitted my form on Saturday but still haven't been granted access(RITM4453177<https://service.northeastern.edu/nav_to.do?uri=sc_req_item.do%3Fsys_id=2e3a1eb093357d54199efc227cba108f%26sysparm_stack=sc_req_item_list.do%3Fsysparm_query=active=true> ). I wanted to follow up; I have an assignment due soon and am starting to panic a bit.  Do I need to submit any additional forms? Or is it held up on my professor's approval? If he has yet to approve, I can reach out to him.

Anything you can do to help me get access asap would be greatly appreciated!!!!

Description : Hi RCHelp, 

I met a weird problem recently. When requesting an a6000 with sbatch, it was slow to be allocated; but when requesting it with srun, it was allocated immediately. If lucky, after tens of minutes or so after executing sbatch, the resource was allocated successfully; sometimes it just stuck for hours. At first I thought cpu or memory was used out on d3168, but it was not the case. We know there was enough available resource. Just wondering if you have any thoughts why this happened. Thank you for your time! Best, Qiwei

Hi,

I did not expect so many people to be involved in this request!

I would like to know the quote for additional storage if possible. However it is unlikely that we will purchase additional storage at this point.

Best regards,
Hoan Tran

Shomo :
hello hoan-

thank you for reaching out to RC ! 

the quota at /work/johnlab is already at
the maximum for free space (35TiB). if
you would like to add additional space, 
please let me know and we can send over
the bits to pay for it, etc. 

happy computing !

Description : Hi RCHelp,

I’m working on training efficient net b7 now and to train more epochs I would need more gpus to run the algorithm within reasonable amount of time.

Now it takes 40 mins to train each epoch on 1 gpu, so to match other teams performance we need to performe 20+ epochs so could you please allocate 4 gpus for amal-lab for more time like 48 hours?

And now I’m facing the CUDA out of memory error and I can only use batchsize = 2 for training. I’ve made sure that the the gpu is clear of other jobs and I tried to set PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF with max_split_size_mb to be less than the memory tried to allocate, and also less than free memory, but still cannot fix it.

Thank you,
Zongyu

Shomo :
hello world-

just checking in on this older ticket. are you all set 
here now ? 

[greg]

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Zongyu,

Thanks for the update. Good to know that you started the training with num_workers=1 this time. 

One of us will get in touch with you regarding the multigpu partition access request that you've raised.

Hi Joshi,

This time I already used num_workers=1 on the reserved partition and it was running. I'm now coding the checkpoint into my code and also submitted a request for multigpu.

Thank you,
Zongyu

m.joshi (Additional comments (Customer Viewable Field)) :
Hi Zongyu,

Could you also run another experiment with num_workers > 0 this time and report to us the progress on the gpu partition? This would be a good benchmarking result for us. Thanks.

Best,
Manasvita Joshi, Ph.D. 
Data Scientist,

Wu :
Sure, I will check how to use checkpoint

Shomo :
hello zongyu-

have you looked at our documentation ? does this section
not apply to your current situation ?

https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/best-practices/checkpointing.html#resuming-training-from-a-checkpoint

please do check that out and let us know. we do everything
that we can to configure the cluster so that you, the researcher,
do not have to wait for us to type something in order to get
your work done. 

additionally, you will note that partition 'multigpu' requires 
some additional work in order to be granted access. that is at

https://rc-docs.northeastern.edu/en/latest/hardware/partitions.html#partition-access-request

please take a look and let us know if you have any questions.

thank you !
[greg]

Wu :
Hi Greg,

Can you allocate another 4day reservation? It's now terminated due to time limit. And aI also tried to use the partition multiphu, but it says `srun: error: Unable to allocate resources: User's group not permitted to use this partition`

Thank you,
Zongyu

Wu :
Sorry I think last time I also just set the num_workers to 0 so that the problem doesn't pop up. But now since the training is already running I think it should be fine at this time.

Amal :
reply from: s.amal@northeastern.edu

Zongyu, its the same fix i did for you when you just started if you remember
We need to solve it with multiple workers

Wu :
Ok now it's moving after I set num_workers to 1; but still I have to use num_workers=1, not any larger number

Wu :
Thank you greg, I'm still facing this error
UserWarning: This DataLoader will create 28 worker processes in total. Our suggested max number of worker in current system is 1, which is smaller than what this DataLoader is going to create. Please be aware that excessive worker creation might get DataLoader running slow or even freeze, lower the worker number to avoid potential slowness/freeze if necessary.
and it freeze at the very beginning `3/3662 [00:17<4:00:33,  3.94s/it`

Shomo :
hello zongyu-

i will not be a good resource to answer those questions,
so let me reach out to the team to see who uses pytorch, etc.

[greg]

Wu :
Hi Greg,

I asked for more time because it takes a long time for training; but now since it's a 4d reservation it should be fine.

Another problem is that it gives this error `UserWarning: This DataLoader will create 4 worker processes in total. Our suggested max number of worker in current system is 1, which is smaller than what this DataLoader is going to create. Please be aware that excessive worker creation might get DataLoader running slow or even freeze, lower the worker number to avoid potential slowness/freeze if necessary.` and the training freeze at the very beginning. I checked that there are 28 cpus so I should be fine with num_worker=4. I also tried setting os.environ["MP_NUM_WORKERS"] = str(28), but still can't fix it. Do you have any suggestion on that?

And do you have suggestion with this type of error? `RuntimeError: CUDA out of memory. Tried to allocate 70.00 MiB (GPU 0; 4.00 GiB total capacity; 2.87 GiB already allocated; 0 bytes free; 2.88 GiB reserved in total by PyTorch) If reserved memory is >> allocated memory try setting max_split_size_mb to avoid fragmentation. See documentation for Memory Management and PYTORCH_CUDA_ALLOC_CONF`
I tried to set `max_split_size_mb` to be less than memory tried to allocate(70 MB in this case) but cannot fix it. I can only run the training with batch size=2, any larger batch size will break which is not as expected, since we have 32 GB on each gpu.

The first question might be accossiated with pytorch version so I tried to update conda and pytorch in my home enviorment `digital_pathology` but it stuck on solving enviornment step and I closed the tab to request a new session, and now it says `srun: job 37242349 queued and waiting for resources`. Could you cancel the current job so that I can start a new one?

Thank you,
Zongyu

reply from: s.amal@northeastern.edu

Thank you, since we are training on large scale datasets with very high resolution images and high computational algorithms.. it takes days to each model training
Thank you Greg, I appreciate your consideration

Shomo :
hello zongyu-

thank you for reaching out to RC !

i've just created a reservation 'amal-lab' with one server
that has 4 x v100 (32g) gpus. everyone in the unix group
'amal-lab' should have access to this, etc.

is the reason you need a reservation for this due to the
24h timelimit in partition multigpu ? setting up reservations
for a group to get work done is a bit of a hack, so we're 
always eager to know why this is required, etc. that helps
us to improve our systems going forwards.

thank you
[greg]

ps. it's a 4d reservation atm.
