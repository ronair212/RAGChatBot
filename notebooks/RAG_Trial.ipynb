        "\n",
        "Introduction to Queuing Systems#\n",
        "The Slurm scheduler manages jobs in the queue. When you submit a job, it gets placed in the queue. The scheduler then assigns resources to the job when they become available, according to the job’s priority and the available resources.\n",
        "\n",
        "Job Submission and Scheduling#\n",
        "Jobs are submitted to the queue via a script specifying the resources required (e.g., number of CPUs, memory, and GPUs) and the commands to be executed. Once submitted, the queuing system schedules the job based on the resources requested, the current system load, and scheduling policies.\n",
        "\n",
        "Scheduling Policies**#\n",
        "Our cluster uses a fair-share scheduling policy. This means that usage is tracked for each user or group, and the system attempts to balance resource allocation over time. If a user or group has been using many resources, their job priority may be temporarily reduced to allow others to use the system. Conversely, users or groups that have used fewer resources will have their jobs prioritized.\n",
        "The following policies ensure fair use of the cluster resources:\n",
        "\n",
        "Single job size: The maximum number of nodes a single job depends on the partition (see Partitions).\n",
        "Run time limit: The maximum run time for a job depends on the partition (see Partitions).\n",
        "Priority decay: If a job remains in the queue without running for an extended period, its priority may slowly decrease.\n",
        "\n",
        "Job Priority**#\n",
        "Several factors determine job priority:\n",
        "\n",
        "Fair-share: This is based on the historical resource usage of your group. The more resources your group has used, the lower your job’s priority becomes, and vice versa.\n",
        "Job size: Smaller jobs (regarding requested nodes) typically have higher priority.\n",
        "Queue wait time: The longer a job has been in the queue, the higher its priority becomes.\n",
        "\n",
        "Job States#\n",
        "Each job in the queue has a state. The main job states are:\n",
        "\n",
        "Pending (PD): The job is waiting for resources to become available.\n",
        "Running (R): The job is currently running.\n",

        "Break up large jobs: Large jobs tend to wait in the queue longer than small jobs. Break up large jobs into smaller ones.\n",

        "In an HPC environment, efficient job scheduling is crucial for allocating computing resources and ensuring optimal cluster utilization.

Understanding these policies is essential for maximizing job efficiency and minimizing wait times.\n",

        "\n",
        "FIFO (First-In-First-Out)#\n",

        "\n",
        "Fair Share#\n",
        "This policy ensures that all users receive a fair share of cluster resources over time. Users with high resource usage may experience reduced priority, allowing others to access resources more regularly.\n",
        "\n",
        "Priority-Based#\n",
        "Jobs are assigned priorities based on user-defined criteria or system-wide rules. Higher-priority jobs are executed before lower-priority ones, allowing for resource allocation based on user requirements.\n",

        "Job Priorities#\n",
        "\n",
        "User Priority#\n",

        "Resource Requirements#\n",
        "Jobs with larger resource requirements may be assigned higher priority, as they require more significant resources to execute efficiently.\n",
        "\n",
        "Walltime Limit#\n",
        "Jobs with shorter estimated execution times may receive higher priority, ensuring they are executed promptly and freeing up resources for other jobs.\n",

        "Balancing Policies#\n",
        "\n",
        "Backfilling#\n",

        "\n",
        "Preemption#\n",
        "Higher-priority jobs can preempt lower-priority ones, temporarily pausing the lower-priority job’s execution to make resources available for the higher-priority job.\n",
        "\n",
        "Best Practices#\n",
        "\n",
        "Set Realistic Priorities: Assign accurate priorities to your jobs to reflect their importance and resource requirements.\n",
        "Use Resource Quotas: Be mindful of the resources you request to prevent over- or underutilization.\n",
