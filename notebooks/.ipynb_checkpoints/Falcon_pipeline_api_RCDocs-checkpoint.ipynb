To make a file name called foo, enter the command (with the name foo as the directory name). Answer: The following commands are Bash commands, which are used to perform tasks in the shell environment. They are listed here for study, to be used in further sections of this tutorial. There is nothing to do here. To write the output, do you run a command? Yes, you can press Enter. To end your terminal program (after you have entered the lines into the shell), do you run the command? Yes, you should run the command. To exit the program, press Enter. To display a list of possible commands, write the command. When you are asked to insert a line into your file using the command, enter a space and the name of a command. Answer: To delete from the end of the line, do you want to enter a line? (y/N) To replace from the beginning of the line, do you want to enter a line?
